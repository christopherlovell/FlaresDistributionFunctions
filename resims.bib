	abstract = {We investigate the evolution of galaxy masses and star formation rates in the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment (EAGLE) simulations. These comprise a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmogony with subgrid models for radiative cooling, star formation, stellar mass loss, and feedback from stars and accreting black holes. The subgrid feedback was calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellar mass function and galaxy sizes. Here we demonstrate that the simulations reproduce the observed growth of the stellar mass density to within 20 per cent. The simulation also tracks the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function out to redshift z = 7, with differences comparable to the plausible uncertainties in the interpretation of the data. Just as with observed galaxies, the specific star formation rates of simulated galaxies are bimodal, with distinct star forming and passive sequences. The specific star formation rates of star forming galaxies are typically 0.2 to 0.4 dex lower than observed, but the evolution of the rates track the observations closely. The unprecedented level of agreement between simulation and data makes EAGLE a powerful resource to understand the physical processes that govern galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We introduce the BlueTides simulation and report initial results for the luminosity functions of the first galaxies and AGN, and their contribution to reionization. BlueTides was run on the BlueWaters cluster at NCSA from \$z=99\$ to \$z=8.0\$ and includes 2\${\textbackslash}times\$7040\${\textasciicircum}3\$ particles in a \$400\$Mpc/h per side box, making it the largest hydrodynamic simulation ever performed at high redshift. BlueTides includes a pressure-entropy formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, gas cooling, star formation (including molecular hydrogen), black hole growth and models for stellar and AGN feedback processes. The star formation rate density in the simulation is a good match to current observational data at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 8-10\$. We find good agreement between observations and the predicted galaxy luminosity function in the currently observable range \$-18{\textbackslash}le M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm UV\} {\textbackslash}le -22.5\$ with some dust extinction required to match the abundance of brighter objects. BlueTides implements a patchy reionization model that produces a fluctuating UV background. BlueTides predicts number counts for galaxies fainter than current observational limits which are consistent with extrapolating the faint end slope of the luminosity function with a power law index \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}sim -1.8\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 8\$ and redshift dependence of \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}sim (1+z){\textasciicircum}\{-0.4\}\$. The AGN population has a luminosity function well fit by a power law with a slope \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}sim -2.4\$ that compares favourably with the deepest CANDELS-Goods fields. We investigate how these luminosity functions affect the progress of reionization, and find that a high Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ escape fraction (\$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{esc\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$) is required if galaxies dominate the ionising photon budget during reionization. Smaller galaxy escape fractions imply a large contribution from faint AGN (down to \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{UV\}=-12\$) which results in a rapid reionization, disfavoured by current observations.},

	abstract = {We present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the "Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments" (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion onto their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z{\textasciitilde}0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$ dex over the full mass range, \$10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textless} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback.

	abstract = {[Abridged] We present the first results of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies to z=0 in spherical regions of radius {\textasciitilde}20 Mpc/h drawn from the Millennium Simulation. The regions have overdensities that deviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the rms mass fluctuation on a scale of {\textasciitilde}20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass resolution of up to 10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale environments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 Millennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising background, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR density at z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an order of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces observational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the GOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear in the underdense regions until z{\textasciitilde}3. These environmental variations are not caused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but rather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to another, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions. At all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity {\textasciitilde} 250 km/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of "downsizing" (even in the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have mostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form at later times. However, additional feedback is required to limit star formation in massive galaxies at late times.},

	abstract = {A growing number of galaxy clusters at z = 1-2 is being discovered as part of deep optical, IR, X-ray, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect surveys. For a complete picture of cluster formation, however, it is important that we also start probing the much earlier epoch, between redshifts of about 2 and 7, during which these clusters and their galaxies first began to form. Because the study of these so-called proto-clusters is currently quite limited by small number statistics, widely varying selection techniques, and many assumptions, we have performed a large systematic study of cluster formation utilizing cosmological simulations. We use the Millennium Simulations to track the evolution of dark matter and galaxies in about 3000 clusters from the earliest times to z = 0. We define an effective radius R e for proto-clusters and characterize their growth in size and mass with cosmic time. We show that the progenitor regions of galaxy clusters (ranging in mass from 10 14 to a few times 10 15 M ? ) can already be identified in galaxy surveys at very early times (at least up to z 5), provided that the galaxy overdensities are measured on a sufficiently large scale ( R e 5-10 Mpc comoving) and with sufficient statistics. We present the overdensities in matter, dark matter halos, and galaxies as functions of present-day cluster mass, redshift, bias, and window size that can be used to interpret the wide range of structures found in real surveys. We also derive the probability that a structure having a galaxy overdensity $\delta$ gal , defined by a set of observational selection criteria, is indeed a proto-cluster, and we show how their z = 0 masses can already be estimated long before virialization. We present overdensity profiles as a function of radius, and we further show how the projected surface overdensities of proto-clusters decrease as the uncertainties in redshift measurements increase. We provide a table of proto-cluster candidates selected from the literature and discuss their properties in light of our simulation predictions. This paper provides the general framework that will allow us to extend the study of cluster formation out to much higher redshifts using the large number of proto-clusters that are expected to be discovered in, e.g., the upcoming HETDEX and Hyper Suprime-Cam surveys.},

in which the supermassive black holes powering luminous z \~{} 6
quasars (QSOs) grow from massive seeds. We simulate 18 regions with
densities ranging from the mean cosmic density to the highest $\sigma$
peaks in the Millennium simulation volume. Only in the most massive
haloes situated in the most overdense regions, can black holes grow to
masses up to ?109 M? by z \~{} 6 without
invoking super-Eddington accretion. Accretion on to the most massive
black holes becomes limited by thermal active galactic nucleus (AGN)
feedback by z \~{} 9-8 with further growth proceeding in short
Eddington-limited bursts. Our modelling suggests that current
flux-limited surveys of QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect
objects at their peak luminosity and therefore miss a substantial
population of QSOs powered by similarly massive black holes but with low
accretion rates. To test whether the required host halo masses are
consistent with the observed galaxy environments of z \~{} 6 QSOs, we
produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies.
Without strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of
bright galaxies larger than observed by a factor of 10 or more.
Supernova-driven galactic winds reduce the predicted numbers to a level
consistent with observations indicating that stellar feedback was
already very efficient at high redshifts. We further investigate the
effect of thermal AGN feedback on the surrounding gas. AGN outflows are
highly anisotropic and mostly energy driven, pushing gas at ?1000
km s-1 out to tens of kpc consistently with observations. The
spatially extended thermal X-ray emission around bright QSOs is powered
by these outflows and is an important diagnostic of the mechanism
whereby AGN feedback energy couples to surrounding gas.},

constraints on T0 at z \~{} 6, we discuss implications for the nature and epoch of H I and He II reionization. We study the extent of the He III region as a function of quasar age and show, for a typical inferred age of z \~{} 6 quasars (i.e. \~{}108 yr), it
extends up to 80 per cent of the H I proximity region. For these long lifetimes, the heating effects can be detected even when all the H I lines from the proximity region are used. Using the flux and curvature probability distribution functions (PDFs), we study the statistical detectability of heating effects as a function of initial physical conditions in the IGM. For the present sample size, cosmic variance dominates the flux PDF. The curvature statistics is more suited to capturing the heating effects beyond the cosmic variance, even if the sample size is half of what is presently available.},

In this Letter, we show that the dependence of quiescence on black hole and stellar mass is a powerful discriminant between differing models for the mechanisms that suppress star formation. Using observations of 91 star-forming and quiescent central galaxies with directly-measured black hole masses, we find that quiescent galaxies host more massive black holes than star-forming galaxies with similar stellar masses. This observational result is in qualitative agreement with models that assume that effective, more-or-less continuous AGN feedback suppresses star formation, strongly suggesting the importance of the black hole in producing quiescence in central galaxies.},

We combine 50, 25, and 12.5 Mpc/h boxes with a quarter billion particles each to show that MUFASA broadly reproduces a wide range of relevant observations, including SFR and specific SFR functions, the mass-metallicity relation, HI and H2 fractions, HI (21 cm) and CO luminosity functions, and cosmic gas density evolution. There are mild but significant discrepancies, such as too many high-SFR galaxies, overly metal-rich and HI-poor galaxies at M*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} Mo, and sSFRs that are too low at z{\textasciitilde}1-2. The HI mass function increases by x2 out to z{\textasciitilde}1 then steepens to higher redshifts, while the CO luminosity function computed using the Narayanan et al. conversion factor shows a rapid increase of CO-bright galaxies out to z{\textasciitilde}2 in accord with data. Omega\_HI and Omega\_H2 both scale roughly as (1+z){\textasciicircum}0.7 out to z{\textasciitilde}3, comparable to the rise in HI and H2 fractions. MUFASA galaxies with high SFR at a given M* have lower metallicities and higher HI and H2 fractions, following observed trends; we make quantitative predictions for how fluctuations in the baryon cycle drive correlated scatter around galaxy scaling relations. Most of these trends are well converged with numerical resolution. These successes highlight MUFASA as a viable platform to study many facets of cosmological galaxy evolution.},

	abstract = {We present a new parallel implementation of the PINpointing Orbit Crossing-Collapsed HIerarchical Objects (pinocchio) algorithm, a quick tool, based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, for the hierarchical build-up of dark matter (DM) haloes in cosmological volumes. To assess its ability to predict halo correlations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an N-body simulation of a 3 h-1 Gpc box sampled with 20483 particles taken from the mice suite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. Thanks to the Fastest Fourier Transforms in the West (FFTW) libraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scaling properties. The CPU time required by pinocchio is a tiny fraction (\~{}1/2000) of that required by the mice simulation. Varying some of pinocchio numerical parameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in the range allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the mice mass function of Friends-of-Friends (FoF) haloes in the high-mass tail. We compare the matter{\textendash}halo and the halo{\textendash}halo power spectra with those of the mice simulation and find that these two-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. In particular, when catalogues are matched in number density, agreement within 10 per cent is achieved for the halo power spectrum. At scales k {\textgreater} 0.1 h Mpc-1, the inaccuracy of the Zel{\textquoteright}dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimate of the power spectrum that can be modelled as a Gaussian factor with a damping scale of d = 3 h-1 Mpc at z = 0, decreasing at higher redshift. Finally, a remarkable match is obtained for the reduced halo bispectrum, showing a good description of non-linear halo bias. Our results demonstrate the potential of pinocchio as an accurate and flexible tool for generating large ensembles of mock galaxy surveys, with interesting applications for the analysis of large galaxy redshift surveys.},

	abstract = {Growing the supermassive black holes ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun) that power the detected luminous, highest redshift quasars (z {\textgreater} 6) from light seeds - the remnants of the first stars - within {\textasciitilde} 1 Gyr of the Big Bang poses a timing challenge for growth models. The formation of massive black hole seeds via direct collapse with initial masses {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}4 - 10{\textasciicircum}5 Msun alleviates this problem. Physical conditions required to form these massive direct collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds are available in the early universe. These viable DCBH formation sites, satellite halos of star-forming galaxies, merge and acquire a stellar component. These produce a new, transient class of objects at high redshift, Obese Black hole Galaxies (OBGs), where the luminosity produced by accretion onto the black hole outshines the stellar component. Therefore, the OBG stage offers a unique way to discriminate between light and massive initial seeds. We predict the multi-wavelength energy output of OBGs and growing Pop III remnants at a fiducial redshift (z = 9), exploring both standard and slim disk accretion onto the growing central black hole for high and low metallicities of the associated stellar population. With our computed templates, we derive the selection criteria for OBGs, that comprise a pre-selection that eliminates blue sources; followed by color-color cuts ([F\_\{070W\} - F\_\{220W\}] {\textgreater} 0; -0.3 {\textless} [F\_\{200W\} - F\_\{444W\}] {\textless} 0.3) and when available, a high ratio of X-ray flux to rest-frame optical flux (F\_X/F\_\{444W\} {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1) (Abridged).},

	abstract = {We present cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation during the epoch of reionisation in an effort towards modelling the interstellar medium (ISM) and interpreting ALMA observations. Simulations with and without stellar radiation are compared at large (Mpc), intermediate (tens of kpc), and small (sub kpc) scales to highlight the differences local stellar radiation can make for the distribution of neutral hydrogen internally to galaxy and externally on the surrounding filaments and intergalactic medium (IGM). At large scales, we find that the dense regions around galaxies reionise first before UV photons penetrate the voids; however, there remains a considerable amount of neutral gas present within the galaxies. The spatial distribution of neutral gas is highly dynamic and is anti-correlated with the presence of stars older than a few Myrs. Likewise, H\$\_2\$ masses in the galaxies are extremely time variable and sensitive to the presence of these same stars. For our specific feedback implementation, most of the metals remain inside the virial radii of galaxies and they are proportionally distributed over the ionised and neutral medium by mass. For our most massive galaxy with \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_h\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, we find that the majority of the CII mass in the galaxy is associated with cold neutral clumps, similar to OI. NII is more diffuse and arises in warmer gas while OIII is associated with the hotter gas produced by photo-heating and supernovae that has a higher ionisation parameter. If small pockets of high metallicity gas exist in the ISM, the emission from these ions may be observable by ALMA while the naturally low metallicity of the galaxy will cause these systems to fall below the local [CII]-SFR relation.

	abstract = {(submitted to MNRAS January 10, 2017) We present synthetic observations for the first generations of galaxies in the Universe and make predictions for future deep field observations for redshifts greater than 6. Due to the strong impact of nebular emission lines and the relatively compact scale of HII regions, high resolution cosmological simulations and a robust suite of analysis tools are required to properly simulate spectra. We created a software pipeline consisting of FSPS, Hyperion, Cloudy and our own tools to generate synthetic IR observations from a fully three-dimensional arrangement of gas, dust, and stars. Our prescription allows us to include emission lines for a complete chemical network and tackle the effect of dust extinction and scattering in the various lines of sight. We provide spectra, 2-D binned photon imagery for both HST and JWST IR filters, luminosity relationships, and emission line strengths for a large sample of high redshift galaxies in the Renaissance Simulations (O'Shea et al. 2015). Our resulting synthetic spectra show high variability between galactic halos with a strong dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, gas mass fraction, and formation history. Halos with the lowest stellar mass have the greatest variability in [OIII]/H\${\textbackslash}beta\$, [OIII] and CIII] while halos with higher masses are seen to show consistency in their spectra and [OIII] equivalent widths (EW) between 1{\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} and 10{\textbackslash}AA. Viewing angle accounted for three-fold difference in flux due to the presence of ionized gas channels in a halo. Furthermore, JWST color plots show a discernible relationship between redshift, color, and mean stellar age.},

	abstract = {Observational searches for faint active nuclei at \$z {\textgreater} 6\$ have been extremely elusive, with a few candidates whose high-\$z\$ nature is still to be confirmed. Interpreting this lack of detections is crucial to improve our understanding of high-\$z\$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formation and growth. In this work, we present a model for the emission of accreting BHs in the X-ray band, taking into account super-Eddington accretion, which can be very common in gas-rich systems at high-\$z\$. We compute the spectral energy distribution for a sample of active galaxies simulated in a cosmological context, which represent the progenitors of a \$z {\textbackslash}sim 6\$ SMBH with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We find an average Compton thick fraction of \${\textbackslash}sim 45{\textbackslash}\%\$ and large typical column densities (\$N\_H {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{23\} {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}2\$). However, faint progenitors are still luminous enough to be detected in the X-ray band of current surveys. Even accounting for a maximum obscuration effect, the number of detectable BHs is reduced at most by a factor 2. In our simulated sample, observations of faint quasars are mainly limited by their very low active fraction (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm act\} {\textbackslash}sim 1 {\textbackslash}\%\$), which is the result of short, super-critical growth episodes. We suggest that to detect high-\$z\$ SMBHs progenitors, large area surveys with shallower sensitivities, such as Cosmos Legacy and XMM-LSS+XXL, are to be preferred with respect to deep surveys probing smaller fields, such as CDF-S.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and
characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model of
cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature
distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25$\sigma$. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma$8)
derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

We demonstrate that the emission from faint unresolved satellite sources, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm UV\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim -17\$, clustered around the central galaxies may play a major role in generating spatially extended Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, continuum (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm UV + VIS\}\$) and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ halos. We apply the analytic formalism developed in Mas-ribas \& Dijkstra (2016) to model the halos around Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) at \$z=3.1\$, for several different satellite clustering prescriptions. In general, our UV and Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ surface brightness profiles match the observations well at \$20{\textbackslash}lesssim r {\textbackslash}lesssim 40\$ physical kpc from the centers of LAEs. We discuss how our profiles depend on various model assumptions and how these can be tested and constrained with future H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows how spatially extended halos constrain (i) the presence of otherwise undetectable satellite sources, (ii) the integrated, volumetric production rates of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and LyC photons, and (iii) their population-averaged escape fractions. These quantities are all directly relevant for understanding galaxy formation and evolution and, for high enough redshifts, cosmic reionization.},

	abstract = {We study the nature of rapidly star-forming galaxies at z=2 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and compare their properties to observations of sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs). We identify simulated SMGs as the most rapidly star-forming systems that match the observed number density of SMGs. In our models, SMGs are massive galaxies sitting at the centres of large potential wells, being fed by smooth infall and gas-rich satellites at rates comparable to their star formation rates (SFR). They are not typically undergoing major mergers that significantly boost their quiescent SFR, but they still often show complex gas morphologies and kinematics. Our simulated SMGs have stellar masses of log M*/Mo{\textasciitilde}11-11.7, SFRs of {\textasciitilde}180-500 Mo/yr, a clustering length of 10 Mpc/h, and solar metallicities. The SFRs are lower than those inferred from far-IR data by a factor of 3, which we suggest may owe to one or more systematic effects in the SFR calibrations. SMGs at z=2 live in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Mo halos, and by z=0 they mostly end up as brightest group galaxies in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}14 Mo halos. We predict that higher-M* SMGs should have on average lower specific SFRs, less disturbed morphologies, and higher clustering. We also predict that deeper far-IR surveys will smoothly join SMGs onto the massive end of the SFR-M* relationship defined by lower-mass z=2 galaxies. Overall, our simulated rapid star-formers provide as good a match to available SMG data as merger-based scenarios, offering an alternative scenario that emerges naturally from cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {The first billion years of the Universe is a pivotal time: stars, black holes (BHs) and galaxies form and assemble, sowing the seeds of galaxies as we know them today. Detecting, identifying and understand- ing the first galaxies and BHs is one of the current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy formation. In this paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at galaxies, BHs and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model builds a population based on empirical relations. Galaxies are characterized by a spectral energy distribution determined by age and metallicity, and AGNs by a spectral energy distribution determined by BH mass and accretion rate. We validate the model against observational constraints, and then predict properties of galaxies and AGN in other wavelength and/or luminosity ranges, estimating the contamination of stellar populations (normal stars and high-mass X-ray binaries) for AGN searches from the infrared to X-rays, and vice-versa for galaxy searches. For high-redshift galaxies, with stellar ages {\textless} 1 Gyr, we find that disentangling stellar and AGN emission is challenging at restframe UV/optical wavelengths, while high-mass X-ray binaries become more important sources of confusion in X-rays. We propose a color-color selection in JWST bands to separate AGN vs star-dominated galaxies in photometric observations. We also esti- mate the AGN contribution, with respect to massive, hot, metal-poor stars, at driving high ionization lines, such as C IV and He II. Finally, we test the influence of the minimum BH mass and occupa- tion fraction of BHs in low mass galaxies on the restframe UV/near-IR and X-ray AGN luminosity function.},

	abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence quite well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z{\textasciitilde}2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z{\textless}1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa only succeeds at the former.},

	abstract = {To understand the evolution of extinction curve, we calculate the dust evolution in a galaxy using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations incorporating stellar dust production, dust destruction in supernova shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by shattering. The dust species are separated into carbonaceous dust and silicate. The evolution of grain size distribution is considered by dividing grain population into large and small gains, which allows us to estimate extinction curves. We examine the dependence of extinction curves on the position, gas density, and metallicity in the galaxy, and find that extinction curves are flat at \$t {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.3\$ Gyr because stellar dust production dominates the total dust abundance. The 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise become prominent after dust growth by accretion. At \$t {\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ Gyr, shattering works efficiently in the outer disc and low density regions, so extinction curves show a very strong 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and steep FUV rise. The extinction curves at \$t{\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ Gyr are consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve, which implies that we successfully included the necessary dust processes in the model. The outer disc component caused by stellar feedback has an extinction curves with a weaker 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and flatter FUV slope. The strong contribution of carbonaceous dust tends to underproduce the FUV rise in the Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve, which supports selective loss of small carbonaceous dust in the galaxy. The snapshot at young ages also explain the extinction curves in high-redshift quasars.},

	abstract = {We present the results of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with zoom-in initial conditions, and investigate the formation of the first galaxies and their evolution towards observable galaxies at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 6\$. We focus on three different galaxies which end up in halos with masses \$M\_\{h\} = 2.4 {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}; M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (Halo-10), \$1.6 {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}; M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (Halo-11) and \$0.7 {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (Halo-12) at z=6. Our simulations also probe impacts of different sub-grid assumptions, i.e., SF efficiency and cosmic reionization, on SF histories in the first galaxies. We find that star formation occurs intermittently due to supernova (SN) feedback at z {\textgreater} 10, and then it proceeds more smoothly as the halo mass grows at lower redshifts. Galactic disks are destroyed due to SN feedback, while galaxies in simulations with no-feedback or lower SF efficiency models can sustain galactic disk for long periods {\textgreater} 10 Myr. The expulsion of gas at the galactic center also affects the inner dark matter density profile. However, SN feedback does not seem to keep the shallow profile of dark matter for a long period. Our simulated galaxies in Halo-11 and Halo-12 reproduce the star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of observed Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitters (LAEs) at z = 7-8 fairly well given observational uncertainties. In addition, we investigate the effect of UV background radiation on star formation as an external feedback source, and find that earlier reionization extends the quenching time of star formation due to photo-ionization heating, but does not affect the stellar mass at z=6.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05063},
	abstract = {Imaging with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow for observing the bulk of distant galaxies at the epoch of reionisation. The recovery of their properties, such as age, color excess E(B-V), specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass, will mostly rely on spectral energy distribution fitting, based on the data provided by JWST's two imager cameras, namely the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infrared Imager (MIRI). In this work we analyze the effect of choosing different combinations of NIRCam and MIRI broad-band filters, from 0.6 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m to 7.7 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m, on the recovery of these galaxy properties. We performed our tests on a sample of 1542 simulated galaxies, with known input properties, at z=7-10. We found that, with only 8 NIRCam broad-bands, we can recover the galaxy age within 0.1 Gyr and the color excess within 0.06 mag for 70\% of the galaxies. Besides, the stellar masses and sSFR are recovered within 0.2 and 0.3 dex, respectively, at z=7-9. Instead, at z=10, no NIRCam band traces purely the \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}{\textgreater} 4000 \{{\textbackslash}AA\} regime and the percentage of outliers in stellar mass (sSFR) increases by {\textgreater} 20\% ({\textgreater} 90\%), in comparison to z=9. The MIRI F560W and F770W bands are crucial to improve the stellar mass and the sSFR estimation at z=10. When nebular emission lines are present, deriving correct galaxy properties is challenging, at any redshift and with any band combination. In particular, the stellar mass is systematically overestimated in up to 0.3 dex on average with NIRCam data alone and including MIRI observations improves only marginally the estimation.},

We predict the stellar mass-halo mass relation, stellar mass function, and luminosity function in several bands from z=5-12. The median stellar mass-halo mass relation does not evolve strongly at z=5-12. The faint-end slope of the luminosity function steepens with increasing redshift, as inherited from the halo mass function at these redshifts. Below z{\textasciitilde}6, the stellar mass function and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function slightly flatten below M\_star{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4.5 M\_sun (fainter than M\_1500{\textasciitilde}-14), owing to the fact that star formation in low-mass halos is suppressed by the ionizing background by the end of reionization. Such flattening does not appear at higher redshifts. We provide redshift-dependent fitting functions for the SFR-M\_halo, SFR-M\_star, and broad-band magnitude-stellar mass relations. We derive the star formation rate density and stellar mass density at z=5-12 and show that the contribution from very faint galaxies becomes more important at z{\textgreater}8. Furthermore, we find that the decline in the z{\textasciitilde}6 UV luminosity function brighter than M\_1500{\textasciitilde}-20 is largely due to dust attenuation. Approximately 37\% (54\%) of the UV luminosity from galaxies brighter than M\_1500=-13 (-17) is obscured by dust at z{\textasciitilde}6.

These observations at 0.3" spatial resolution show a compact ({\textasciitilde}3kpc) main galaxy in dust and [C II] emission, with a 'tail' of emission extending to the east by about 5kpc (in projection). The [C II] tail is comprised predominantly of two distinct sub-components in velocity, separated from the core by {\textasciitilde}100 and 250km/s, with narrow intrinsic widths of about 80km/s, which we call 'sub-galaxies'. The sub-galaxies themselves are extended east-west by about 3kpc in individual channel images. The [C II] tail joins smoothly into the main galaxy velocity field. The [C II] line to continuum ratios are comparable for the main and sub-galaxy positions, within a factor 2. In addition, these ratios are comparable to z{\textasciitilde}5.5 LBGs. We conjecture that the WMH5 system represents the early formation of a galaxy through the accretion of smaller satellite galaxies, embedded in a smoother gas distribution, along a possibly filamentary structure. The results are consistent with current cosmological
simulations of early galaxy formation, and support the idea of very early enrichment with dust and heavy elements of the accreting material.},

We investigate the implications of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N -body simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto)clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z = 0 to z = 7. We show that (proto)cluster galaxies are an important and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density rises (from 1\% at z = 0) to 20\% at z = 2 and 50\% at z = 10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described by three distinct phases: at z \~{} 10{\textendash}5, galaxy growth in protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the universe; at z \~{} 5{\textendash}1.5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10{\textendash}20 Mpc structures, forming most of their present-day stellar mass; at z ? 1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results motivate observations of distant protoclusters in order to understand the rapid, extended stellar growth during cosmic noon, and their connection to reionization during cosmic dawn.},

primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections,
stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment,
supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic
nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic
predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with
observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume
contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of
morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular
galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star
formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon
conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the
impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The
internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies
obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat
circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation
reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our

simulations consisting of thousands of halos up to M\_halo{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun
(M\_star{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10.5 M\_sun) at z{\textgreater}=5 from the Feedback in Realistic
Environments project. We post-process our simulations with a
three-dimensional Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer code to study dust
extinction, dust emission, and dust temperature within these simulated
z{\textgreater}=5 galaxies. Our sample forms a tight correlation between infrared
excess (IRX=F\_IR/F\_UV) and ultraviolet (UV)-continuum slope (beta\_UV),
despite the patchy, clumpy dust geometry shown in our simulations. We
find that the IRX-beta\_UV relation is mainly determined by the shape of
the extinction curve and is independent of its normalization (set by the
dust-to-gas ratio). The bolometric IR luminosity (L\_IR) correlates with
the intrinsic UV luminosity and the star formation rate (SFR) averaged
over the past 10 Myr. We predict that at a given L\_IR, the peak
wavelength of the dust spectral energy distributions for z{\textgreater}=5
galaxies is smaller by a factor of 2 (due to higher dust temperatures on
average) than at z=0. The higher dust temperatures are driven by higher
specific SFRs and SFR surface densities with increasing redshift. We
derive the galaxy UV luminosity functions (LFs) at z=5-10 from our
simulations and confirm that a heavy attenuation is required to
reproduce the observed bright-end UVLFs. We also predict the IRLFs and
UV luminosity densities at z=5-10. We discuss the implications of our
results on current and future observations probing dust attenuation and
emission in z{\textgreater}=5 galaxies.},

that the median galaxy size scales with redshift as \$R\_e {\textbackslash}propto

halo specific angular momentum is typically less than one and decreases
with halo and stellar mass. This relation shows no redshift dependence,
while the relation between specific angular momentum and stellar mass
decreases by \${\textbackslash}sim0.5\$ dex from \$z=7\$ to \$2\$. Our model reproduces the
distribution of local galaxy morphologies, with bulges formed
predominantly through galaxy mergers for low-mass galaxies,
disc-instabilities for galaxies with
\$M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbackslash}simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and major mergers for the most

In this paper, we introduce the sample and present the low-redshift global properties of the clusters. We calculate the X-ray properties in a manner consistent with observational techniques, demonstrating the bias and scatter introduced by using estimated masses. We find the total stellar content and black hole masses of the clusters to be in good agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters are too gas rich, suggesting that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model is not efficient enough at expelling gas from the high-redshift progenitors of the clusters. The X-ray properties, such as the spectroscopic temperature and the soft-band luminosity, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich properties are in reasonable agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters have too high central temperatures and larger-than-observed entropy cores, which is likely driven by the AGN feedback after the cluster core has formed. The total metal content and its distribution throughout the intracluster medium are a good match to the observations.},

	abstract = {We study the characteristics of galaxy protoclusters using the latest L-GALAXIES semi-analytic model. Searching for protoclusters on a scale of \~{}10 cMpc gives an excellent compromise between the completeness and purity of their galaxy populations, leads to high distinction from the field in overdensity space, and allows accurate determination of the descendant cluster mass. This scale is valid over a range of redshifts and selection criteria. We present a procedure for estimating, given a measured galaxy overdensity, the protocluster probability and its descendant cluster mass for a range of modelling assumptions,
particularly taking into account the shape of the measurement aperture. This procedure produces lower protocluster probabilities compared to previous estimates using fixed size apertures. The relationship between active galactic nucleus (AGN) and protoclusters is also investigated and shows significant evolution with redshift; at z \~{} 2, the fraction of protoclusters traced by AGN is high, but the fraction of all AGNs in protoclusters is low, whereas at z >= 5 the fraction of protoclusters containing AGN is low, but most AGNs are in protoclusters. We also find indirect evidence for the emergence of a passive sequence in
protoclusters at z \~{} 2, and note that a significant fraction of
all galaxies reside in protoclusters at z >= 2, particularly the most massive.},
