	abstract = {We investigate the evolution of galaxy masses and star formation rates in the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment (EAGLE) simulations. These comprise a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmogony with subgrid models for radiative cooling, star formation, stellar mass loss, and feedback from stars and accreting black holes. The subgrid feedback was calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellar mass function and galaxy sizes. Here we demonstrate that the simulations reproduce the observed growth of the stellar mass density to within 20 per cent. The simulation also tracks the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function out to redshift z = 7, with differences comparable to the plausible uncertainties in the interpretation of the data. Just as with observed galaxies, the specific star formation rates of simulated galaxies are bimodal, with distinct star forming and passive sequences. The specific star formation rates of star forming galaxies are typically 0.2 to 0.4 dex lower than observed, but the evolution of the rates track the observations closely. The unprecedented level of agreement between simulation and data makes EAGLE a powerful resource to understand the physical processes that govern galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We present high-redshift predictions of the star-formation-rate distribution function (SFR DF), UV luminosity function (UV LF), galactic stellar mass function (GSMF), and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies from the latest version of the Munich semi-analytic model L-Galaxies. We find a good fit to both the shape and normalisation of the SFR DF at \$z=4-7\$, apart from a slight under-prediction at the low SFR end at \$z=4\$. Likewise, we find a good fit to the faint number counts for the observed UV LF; at brighter magnitudes our predictions lie below the observations, increasingly so at higher redshifts. At all redshifts and magnitudes, the raw (unattenuated) number counts for the UV LF lie above the observations. Because of the good agreement with the SFR we interpret our under-prediction as an over-estimate of the amount of dust in the model for the brightest galaxies, especially at high-redshift. While the shape of our GSMF matches that of the observations, we lie between (conflicting) observations at \$z=4-5\$, and under-predict at \$z=6-7\$. The sSFRs of our model galaxies show the observed trend of increasing normalisation with redshift, but do not reproduce the observed mass dependence. Overall, we conclude that the latest version of L-Galaxies, which is tuned to match observations at \$z{\textbackslash}leq3\$, does a fair job of reproducing the observed properties of galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}geq4\$. More work needs to be done on understanding observational bias at high-redshift, and upon the dust model, before strong conclusions can be drawn on how to interpret remaining discrepancies between the model and observations.},

We show, using BlueTides, the first hydrodynamic simulation large enough to resolve the relevant scales, that the first massive galaxies to form are \%in fact predicted to have extensive rotationally-supported disks. Although their morphology resembles in some ways Milky-way types seen at much lower redshifts, these high-redshift galaxies are smaller, denser, and richer in gas than their low redshift counterparts. From a kinematic analysis of a statistical sample of 216 galaxies at redshift \$z=8-10\$ we have found that disk galaxies make up 70{\textbackslash}\% of the population of galaxies with stellar mass \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ or greater. Cold Dark Matter cosmology therefore makes specific predictions for the population of large galaxies 500 million years after the Big Bang. We argue that wide-field satellite telescopes (e.g. WFIRST) will in the near future discover these first massive disk galaxies. The simplicity of their structure and formation history should make possible new tests of cosmology.},

	abstract = {We present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the "Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments" (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion onto their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

We take into account obscuration by dust in birth clouds and diffuse ISM using a two-component screen model, following the prescription of Charlot and Fall. We compare models in which the dust optical depth is constant to models where it depends on gas metallicity, gas fraction and orientation. The colours of EAGLE galaxies for the more sophisticated models are in broad agreement with those of observed galaxies. In particular, EAGLE produces a red sequence of passive galaxies and a blue cloud of star forming galaxies, with approximately the correct fraction of galaxies in each population and with g-r colours within 0.1 magnitudes of those observed. Luminosity functions from UV to NIR wavelengths differ from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resulting from a choice between Petrosian and Kron photometric apertures. Despite the generally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. The blue cloud of EAGLE galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than in the data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction in massive EAGLE galaxies. There is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxies compared to observations. The overall level of agreement with the observed colour distribution suggests that EAGLE galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages, metallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those of observed galaxies.},

The observed UV luminosity functions for the samples are consistent with previous observations; however, we find that the observed MUV-M* relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constant mass-to-light ratio and a normalization which evolves with redshift. Our stellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ($\alpha$ ? -1.9), steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of the UV luminosity function.

A mass-luminosity relation with strongly luminosity-dependent M/Luv ratios is found for the largest sample (299 galaxies) at z 4. The relation M {\textbackslash}propto L\_\{UV,1500\}{\textasciicircum}(1.7+/-0.2) has a well-determined intrinsic sample variance of 0.5 dex. This relation is also consistent with the more limited samples at z 5-7. This z 4 mass-luminosity relation, and the well-established faint UV luminosity functions at z 4-7, are used to derive galaxy mass functions (MF) to masses M{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 at z 4-7. A bootstap approach is used to derive the MFs to account for the large scatter in the M--Luv relation and the luminosity function uncertainties, along with an analytical crosscheck. The MFs are also corrected for the effects of incompleteness. The incompleteness-corrected MFs are steeper than previously found, with slopes {\textbackslash}alpha\_M-1.4 to -1.6 at low masses. These slopes are, however, still substantially flatter than the MFs obtained from recent hydrodynamical simulations.

The regions have overdensities that deviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the rms mass fluctuation on a scale of {\textasciitilde}20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass resolution of up to 10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale environments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 Millennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising background, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR density at z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an order of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces observational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the GOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear in the underdense regions until z{\textasciitilde}3. These environmental variations are not caused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but rather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to another, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions. At all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity {\textasciitilde} 250 km/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of "downsizing" (even in the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have mostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form at later times.

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma${\textasciitilde}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2
Msolar and $\sigma${\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. We also provide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\textasciitilde} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\textasciitilde} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LCDM.

We describe an updated, Bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method that incorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories that are constant or rising with time, and different dust-attenuation prescriptions (starburst and Small Magellanic Cloud). From z = 6.5 to z = 3.5 star-forming galaxies in CANDELS follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar mass and SFR that followsSFR \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/799/2/183/apj506362ieqn1.gif] \$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textasciicircum}a\$ with a =0.54 {\textpm} 0.16 at z 6 and 0.70 {\textpm} 0.21 at z 4.

The selection of z{\textasciitilde}4-8 galaxies over the five CANDELS fields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations are apparent at z{\textgreater}=7. Our new LF determinations at z{\textasciitilde}4 and z{\textasciitilde}5 span a 6-mag baseline (-22.5 to -16 AB mag). These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of {\textgreater}L* galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings to 3.4 sigma significance for a steeper faint-end slope to the UV LF at z{\textgreater}4, with alpha evolving from alpha=-1.64+/-0.04 at z{\textasciitilde}4 to alpha=-2.06+/-0.13 at z{\textasciitilde}7 (and alpha = -2.02+/-0.23 at z{\textasciitilde}8), consistent with that expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. With our improved constraints at the bright end, we find less evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* over the redshift range z{\textasciitilde}4 to z{\textasciitilde}7; the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes in phi*. No evidence for a non-Schechter-like form to the z{\textasciitilde}4-8 LFs is found. A simple conditional LF model based on halo growth and evolution in the M/L ratio of halos ((1+z)**-1.5) provides a good representation of the observed evolution.},

Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results requires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface density threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure stripping in haloes less massive than \~{}1014M?\~{}1014M?\{{\textbackslash}sim \}10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, M\_\{\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\}, and to modify our model for radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass. Massive galaxies (log M*/M? >= 11.0) assemble most of their mass before z = 1 and are predominantly old and passive at z = 0, while lower mass galaxies assemble later and, for log M*/M? <= 9.5, are still predominantly blue and star forming at z = 0. This phenomenological but physically based model allows the observations to be interpreted in terms of the efficiency of the various processes that control the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass, gas content, environment and time.},

	abstract = {A growing number of galaxy clusters at z = 1-2 is being discovered as part of deep optical, IR, X-ray, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect surveys. For a complete picture of cluster formation, however, it is important that we also start probing the much earlier epoch, between redshifts of about 2 and 7, during which these clusters and their galaxies first began to form. Because the study of these so-called proto-clusters is currently quite limited by small number statistics, widely varying selection techniques, and many assumptions, we have performed a large systematic study of cluster formation utilizing cosmological simulations. We use the Millennium Simulations to track the evolution of dark matter and galaxies in about 3000 clusters from the earliest times to z = 0. We define an effective radius R e for proto-clusters and characterize their growth in size and mass with cosmic time. We show that the progenitor regions of galaxy clusters (ranging in mass from 10 14 to a few times 10 15 M ? ) can already be identified in galaxy surveys at very early times (at least up to z 5), provided that the galaxy overdensities are measured on a sufficiently large scale ( R e 5-10 Mpc comoving) and with sufficient statistics. We present the overdensities in matter, dark matter halos, and galaxies as functions of present-day cluster mass, redshift, bias, and window size that can be used to interpret the wide range of structures found in real surveys. We also derive the probability that a structure having a galaxy overdensity $\delta$ gal , defined by a set of observational selection criteria, is indeed a proto-cluster, and we show how their z = 0 masses can already be estimated long before virialization. We present overdensity profiles as a function of radius, and we further show how the projected surface overdensities of proto-clusters decrease as the uncertainties in redshift measurements increase. We provide a table of proto-cluster candidates selected from the literature and discuss their properties in light of our simulation predictions. This paper provides the general framework that will allow us to extend the study of cluster formation out to much higher redshifts using the large number of proto-clusters that are expected to be discovered in, e.g., the upcoming HETDEX and Hyper Suprime-Cam surveys.},

in which the supermassive black holes powering luminous z \~{} 6
quasars (QSOs) grow from massive seeds. We simulate 18 regions with
densities ranging from the mean cosmic density to the highest $\sigma$
peaks in the Millennium simulation volume. Only in the most massive
haloes situated in the most overdense regions, can black holes grow to
masses up to ?109 M? by z \~{} 6 without
invoking super-Eddington accretion. Accretion on to the most massive
black holes becomes limited by thermal active galactic nucleus (AGN)
feedback by z \~{} 9-8 with further growth proceeding in short
Eddington-limited bursts. Our modelling suggests that current
flux-limited surveys of QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect
objects at their peak luminosity and therefore miss a substantial
population of QSOs powered by similarly massive black holes but with low
accretion rates. To test whether the required host halo masses are
consistent with the observed galaxy environments of z \~{} 6 QSOs, we
produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies.
Without strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of
bright galaxies larger than observed by a factor of 10 or more.
Supernova-driven galactic winds reduce the predicted numbers to a level
consistent with observations indicating that stellar feedback was
already very efficient at high redshifts. We further investigate the
effect of thermal AGN feedback on the surrounding gas. AGN outflows are
highly anisotropic and mostly energy driven, pushing gas at ?1000
km s-1 out to tens of kpc consistently with observations. The
spatially extended thermal X-ray emission around bright QSOs is powered
by these outflows and is an important diagnostic of the mechanism
whereby AGN feedback energy couples to surrounding gas.},

constraints on T0 at z \~{} 6, we discuss implications for the nature and epoch of H I and He II reionization. We study the extent of the He III region as a function of quasar age and show, for a typical inferred age of z \~{} 6 quasars (i.e. \~{}108 yr), it
extends up to 80 per cent of the H I proximity region. For these long lifetimes, the heating effects can be detected even when all the H I lines from the proximity region are used. Using the flux and curvature probability distribution functions (PDFs), we study the statistical detectability of heating effects as a function of initial physical conditions in the IGM. For the present sample size, cosmic variance dominates the flux PDF. The curvature statistics is more suited to capturing the heating effects beyond the cosmic variance, even if the sample size is half of what is presently available.},

To assess its ability to predict halo correlations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an N-body simulation of a 3 h-1 Gpc box sampled with 20483 particles taken from the mice suite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. Thanks to the Fastest Fourier Transforms in the West (FFTW) libraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scaling properties. The CPU time required by pinocchio is a tiny fraction (\~{}1/2000) of that required by the mice simulation. Varying some of pinocchio numerical parameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in the range allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the mice mass function of Friends-of-Friends (FoF) haloes in the high-mass tail. We compare the matter{\textendash}halo and the halo{\textendash}halo power spectra with those of the mice simulation and find that these two-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. In particular, when catalogues are matched in number density, agreement within 10 per cent is achieved for the halo power spectrum. At scales k {\textgreater} 0.1 h Mpc-1, the inaccuracy of the Zel{\textquoteright}dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimate of the power spectrum that can be modelled as a Gaussian factor with a damping scale of d = 3 h-1 Mpc at z = 0, decreasing at higher redshift. Finally, a remarkable match is obtained for the reduced halo bispectrum, showing a good description of non-linear halo bias. Our results demonstrate the potential of pinocchio as an accurate and flexible tool for generating large ensembles of mock galaxy surveys, with interesting applications for the analysis of large galaxy redshift surveys.},

The space density of luminous galaxies has been shown to decrease by 15{\textendash}20{\texttimes} over 4{\textless}z{\textless}8. Over this same redshift interval, the faint-end slope of the UV luminosity function becomes steeper ($\alpha$?-2.0 at z?7-8), revealing a dominant population of low-luminosity galaxies. Analysis of multiwavelength imaging from HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope demonstrates that z{\textgreater}6 UV-selected galaxies are relatively compact with blue UV continuum slopes, low stellar masses, and large specific star formation rates. In the last year, ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter Array) and ground-based infrared spectrographs have begun to complement this picture, revealing minimal dust obscuration and hard radiation fields, and providing evidence for metal-poor ionized gas. Weak low-ionization absorption lines suggest a patchy distribution of neutral gas surrounds O and B stars, possibly aiding in the escape of ionizing radiation. Gamma ray burst afterglows and Lyman-$\alpha$ surveys have provided evidence that the intergalactic medium (IGM) evolves from mostly ionized at z?6-6.5 to considerably neutral at z?7-8 . The reionization history that emerges from considering the UV output of galaxies over 6{\textless}z{\textless}10 is consistent with these constraints on the IGM ionization state. The latest measurements suggest that galaxies can complete reionization by z?6 and reproduce the Thomson scattering optical depth faced by cosmic microwave background photons if the luminosity function extends ?4 mag below current surveys and a moderate fraction of ionizing radiation escapes from galaxies.},

Interpreting this lack of detections is crucial to improve our understanding of high-\$z\$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formation and growth. In this work, we present a model for the emission of accreting BHs in the X-ray band, taking into account super-Eddington accretion, which can be very common in gas-rich systems at high-\$z\$. We compute the spectral energy distribution for a sample of active galaxies simulated in a cosmological context, which represent the progenitors of a \$z {\textbackslash}sim 6\$ SMBH with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$.

However, faint progenitors are still luminous enough to be detected in the X-ray band of current surveys. Even accounting for a maximum obscuration effect, the number of detectable BHs is reduced at most by a factor 2. In our simulated sample, observations of faint quasars are mainly limited by their very low active fraction (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm act\} {\textbackslash}sim 1 {\textbackslash}\%\$), which is the result of short, super-critical growth episodes. We suggest that to detect high-\$z\$ SMBHs progenitors, large area surveys with shallower sensitivities, such as Cosmos Legacy and XMM-LSS+XXL, are to be preferred with respect to deep surveys probing smaller fields, such as CDF-S.},

	abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of
observational surveys of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We simulate the assembly of a massive rich cluster and the formation of its constituent galaxies in a flat, low-density universe. Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2{\texttimes}107 dark
matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure
identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and
characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model of
cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature
distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25$\sigma$. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma$8)
derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

We summarise the key goals and design of the survey and provide a detailed description of our data reduction techniques. We provide stacked, sky-subtracted images in YJHKs and narrow-band filters constructed from data collected during the first year of UltraVISTA observations. Our stacked images reach 5$\sigma$AB depths in an aperture of 2' diameter of {\textasciitilde}25 in Y
and {\textasciitilde}24 in JHKs bands and all have sub-arcsecond seeing. To this 5$\sigma$ limit, our Ks catalogue contains 216 268
sources. We carry out a series of quality assessment tests on our images and catalogues, comparing our stacks with existing catalogues. The 1$\sigma$ astrometric rms in both directions for stars selected with 17.0 {\textless} Ks(AB) {\textless} 19.5 is {\textasciitilde}0.08' in comparison to the
publicly-available COSMOS ACS catalogues. Our images are resampled to the same pixel scale and tangent point as the publicly available COSMOS data and so may be easily used to generate multi-colour catalogues using this data. All images and catalogues presented in this paper are publicly available through ESO's "phase 3" archiving and distribution system and from the UltraVISTA web site.

	abstract = {We study the nature of rapidly star-forming galaxies at z=2 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and compare their properties to observations of sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs). We identify simulated SMGs as the most rapidly star-forming systems that match the observed number density of SMGs. In our models, SMGs are massive galaxies sitting at the centres of large potential wells, being fed by smooth infall and gas-rich satellites at rates comparable to their star formation rates (SFR). They are not typically undergoing major mergers that significantly boost their quiescent SFR, but they still often show complex gas morphologies and kinematics. Our simulated SMGs have stellar masses of log M*/Mo{\textasciitilde}11-11.7, SFRs of {\textasciitilde}180-500 Mo/yr, a clustering length of 10 Mpc/h, and solar metallicities. The SFRs are lower than those inferred from far-IR data by a factor of 3, which we suggest may owe to one or more systematic effects in the SFR calibrations. SMGs at z=2 live in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Mo halos, and by z=0 they mostly end up as brightest group galaxies in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}14 Mo halos. We predict that higher-M* SMGs should have on average lower specific SFRs, less disturbed morphologies, and higher clustering. We also predict that deeper far-IR surveys will smoothly join SMGs onto the massive end of the SFR-M* relationship defined by lower-mass z=2 galaxies. Overall, our simulated rapid star-formers provide as good a match to available SMG data as merger-based scenarios, offering an alternative scenario that emerges naturally from cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

For z 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities ( L 8 $\mu$m {\textless} 10 11 L ? ), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20\%-30\% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L 8 $\mu$m {\textgreater} 10 11 L ? , show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 $\mu$m-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z = 2 was larger by a factor of 4 and 30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z = 1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z = 2 are relatively "transparent" to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] gtrsim 400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z = 2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z {\textgreater} 1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

We find that H-alpha emitters are located in the outskirts of the density peak (cluster core) dominated by passive red-sequence galaxies. This resembles the situation in lower-redshift clusters, suggesting that the newly discovered structure is a well-evolved rich galaxy cluster at z=1.5. Our data suggest that the color-density and stellar mass-density relations are already in place at z{\textasciitilde}1.5, mostly driven by the passive red massive galaxies residing within Rc{\textless}200 kpc from the cluster core. These environmental trends almost disappear when we consider only star-forming (SF) galaxies. We do not find SFR-density or SSFR-density relations amongst SF galaxies, and the location of the SF main sequence does not significantly change with environment. Nevertheless, we find a tentative hint that star-bursting galaxies (up-scattered objects from the main sequence) are preferentially located in a small group at {\textasciitilde}1-Mpc away from the main body of the cluster. We also argue that the scatter of the SF main sequence could be dependent on the distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy.},

	abstract = {Panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is a critical tool for determining the physical properties of distant galaxies, such as their stellar mass and star formation rate. One widely used method is the publicly available MAGPHYS code. We build on our previous analysis (Hayward \& Smith 2015) by presenting some modifications which enable MAGPHYS to automatically estimate galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), including uncertainties, based on ultra-violet to far-infrared photometry. We use state-of-the art synthetic photometry derived by performing three-dimensional dust radiative transfer on hydrodynamic simulations of isolated disc and merging galaxies to test how well the modified MAGPHYS is able to recover SFHs under idealised conditions, where the true SFH is known. We find that while the SFH of the model with the best fit to the synthetic photometry is a poor representation of the true SFH (showing large variations with the line-of-sight to the galaxy and spurious bursts of star formation), median-likelihood SFHs generated by marginalising over the default MAGPHYS libraries produce robust estimates of the smoothly-varying isolated disk simulation SFHs. This preference for the median-likelihood SFH is quantitatively underlined by our estimates of \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm SFH\}\}\$ (analogous to the \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ goodness-of-fit estimator) and \${\textbackslash}Delta M/M\$ (the integrated absolute mass discrepancy between the model and true SFH) that strongly prefer the median-likelihood SFHs over those that best fit the UV-to-far-IR photometry. In contrast, we are unable to derive a good estimate of the SFH for the merger simulations (either best-fit or median-likelihood) despite being able to obtain a reasonable fit to the simulated photometry, likely because the analytic SFHs with bursts superposed in the standard MAGPHYS library are insufficiently general/realistic.},

Our fiducial (50 Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 volume is evolved to z=0 with a quarter billion particles, The predicted galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF) reproduce observations from z=4-0 to {\textless}1.2sigma in cosmic variance, providing an unprecedented match to this key diagnostic. The cosmic star formation history and stellar mass growth show general agreement with data, with a strong archaeological downsizing trend such that dwarf galaxies form the majority of their stars after z{\textasciitilde}1. We run 25 Mpc/h and 12.5 Mpc/h volumes to z=2 with identical feedback prescriptions, the latter resolving all hydrogen-cooling halos, and the three runs display fair resolution convergence. The specific star formation rates broadly agree with data at z=0, but are underpredicted at z{\textasciitilde}2 by a factor of three, re-emphasizing a longstanding puzzle in galaxy evolution models. We compare runs using MFM and two flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, and show that the GSMF is sensitive to hydrodynamics methodology at the {\textasciitilde}x2 level, which is sub-dominant to choices for parameterising feedback.},

Furthermore, we derive distribution functions of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity and stellar mass in group and intergroup regions, approximately corresponding to 30 times and 8 times higher densities than the general field. As a consequence, we identify by 0.7 and 0.9 dex higher cutoffs in H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity and stellar mass functions in the dense groups, respectively. On the other hand, HAEs in the intergroup environment of the protocluster show similar distribution functions to those of field galaxies despite residing in significant overdensities. In the early phase of cluster formation, as inferred from our results, the densest parts in the protocluster have had an accelerated formation of massive galaxies. We expect that these eventually grow and transform into early-type galaxies at the bright end of the red sequence as seen in present-day rich clusters of galaxies.},

In addition, we present a compilation of UV, IR and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z {\textless} 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0-8\$ as well. We demonstrate that SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 1-10 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z {\textless} 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100 {\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (\$z {\textbackslash}sim 2\$) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100 {\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively rare high mass halos (\$ \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Halo\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11-13\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$) even at the earliest epochs.},

These protoclusters are promising candidates for the most massive class of galaxy clusters seen today (Paper I). The confirmed HAEs in the protoclusters at \$z{\textgreater}2\$ show high excitation levels as characterized by much higher [OIII]/H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ or [OIII]/H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line ratios than those of general galaxies at low-\$z\$. Such a high excitation level may not only be driven by high specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and lower gaseous metallicities, but also be contributed by some other effects. We investigate the environmental dependence of gaseous metallicities by comparing the HAEs in the protoclusters with those in the general field at similar redshifts. We find that the gaseous metallicities of protocluster galaxies are more chemically enriched than those of field galaxies at a given stellar mass in the range of M\$\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. This can be attributed to many processes, such as intrinsic (or nature) effects, external (or nurture) effects, and/or some systematic sampling effects. We also find that the offset of the mass-metallicity relation in dense environment becomes larger at higher redshifts. This can be naturally understood by the fact that the in/out-flow rates in star forming galaxies are much higher at higher redshifts. Therefore the environmental dependence of such "feeding" and "feedback" mechanisms in galaxy formation are probably playing major roles in producing the offset of the mass-metallicity relation for the protocluster galaxies at \$z{\textgreater}2\$.},

We investigate the implications of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N -body simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto)clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z = 0 to z = 7. We show that (proto)cluster galaxies are an important and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density rises (from 1\% at z = 0) to 20\% at z = 2 and 50\% at z = 10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described by three distinct phases: at z \~{} 10{\textendash}5, galaxy growth in protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the universe; at z \~{} 5{\textendash}1.5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10{\textendash}20 Mpc structures, forming most of their present-day stellar mass; at z ? 1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results motivate observations of distant protoclusters in order to understand the rapid, extended stellar growth during cosmic noon, and their connection to reionization during cosmic dawn.},

Using data from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging from the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR-M* relation at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared SEDs of galaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad range of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations. We find that the SFR-M* relation is not consistent with a single power-law of the form SFR {\textasciitilde} M*{\textasciicircum}a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a{\textasciitilde}1 at low masses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (M\_0) that ranges from 10{\textasciicircum}9.5 - 10{\textasciicircum}10.8 Msol, with evidence that M\_0 increases with redshift. We compare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR-M* relation albeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR-M* sequence to generate SFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and decline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive galaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass-growth histories and compare to the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. We find that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that there is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs suggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from the stellar mass function. However, at later times the SFHs under-predict the inferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due to mergers.},

	abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the approximate redshift (z) range 8-1.5. It will image {\textgreater}250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope, from the mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia supernovae at z {\textgreater} 1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 109 M ? to z ? 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z ? 8. The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS/Deep survey (5$\sigma$ point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers {\textasciitilde}125 arcmin2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5$\sigma$ point-source limit of H {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science
investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design. The Hubble data processing and products are described in a companion paper.},

with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a
limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1

logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\textgreater}1,
while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of
the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of
SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend
{\textasciitilde}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2(4) of
their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of
the evolution of SF since z{\textasciitilde}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the
average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of
starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in
starbursts. LIRGs at z{\textasciitilde}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for
massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same
set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching
processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant
role.},

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z {\textless} 0.2. We develop a
method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be

(random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic)
h7010-2 Msolar yr-1
Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the
low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* {\textgreater} 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is
0.408+0.005-0.002
(random)+0.029-0.090
(systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance
cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of
7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\r A}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

It is the first time that these relations can be followed over such a large redshift range from a single homogeneously selected sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts.

The observed sSFR evolution over a large redshift range 0 {\textless}{\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless} 5 and our finding of a non-linear main sequence at high mass both indicate that the evolution of SFR and {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}*{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is not solely driven by gas accretion.

We then derive a star-forming sequence that reproduces the evolution of the mass function by design. This star-forming sequence is also well described by a broken power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. At z = 2, it is offset by 0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent with the mild disagreement between the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and recent observations of the growth of the stellar mass density. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in other self-consistent models of galaxy evolution, including semianalytical, hydrodynamical, and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we demonstrate that neither mergers nor hidden low-mass quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the mass function and the star-forming sequence.

softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells

18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle
count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes:
primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections,
stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment,
supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic
nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic
predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with
observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume
contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of
morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular
galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star
formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon
conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the
impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The
internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies
obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat
circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation
reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our
model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the
halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from
supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

Gravitational lensing combined with deep HST observations allows us to extend the analysis of the MS down to \{log\} M/\{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}? {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}? 7.5 at z? 4 and \{log\} M/\{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}? {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}? 8 at higher redshifts, a factor of ?10 below most previous results. We perform an accurate simulation to take into account the effect of observational uncertainties and correct for the Eddington bias. This step allows us to reliably measure the MS and in particular its slope. While the normalization increases with redshift, we fit an unevolving and approximately linear slope. We nicely extend to lower masses the results of brighter surveys. Thanks to the large dynamic range in mass and by making use of the simulation, we analyzed any possible mass dependence of the dispersion around the MS. We find tentative evidence that the scatter decreases with increasing mass, suggesting a larger variety of star formation histories in low-mass galaxies. This trend agrees with theoretical predictions and is explained as either a consequence of the smaller number of progenitors of low-mass galaxies in a hierarchical scenario and/or of the efficient but intermittent stellar feedback processes in low-mass halos. Finally, we observe an increase in the SFR per unit stellar mass with redshift milder than predicted by theoretical models, implying a still incomplete understanding of the processes responsible for galaxy growth.},

	abstract = {We present results on the star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass ( M * ) relation (i.e., the {\textquotedblleft}main sequence{\textquotedblright}) among star-forming galaxies at 1.37 <= z <= 2.61 using the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. Based on a sample of 261 galaxies with H $\alpha$ and H $\beta$ spectroscopy, we have estimated robust dust-corrected instantaneous SFRs over a large range in M * (\~{}10 9.5 {\textendash}10 11.5 M ? ). We find a correlation between log(SFR(H $\alpha$ )) and log( M * ) with a slope of 0.65 {\textpm} 0.08 (0.58 {\textpm} 0.10) at 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6 (2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6). We find that different assumptions for the dust correction, such as using the color excess of the stellar continuum to correct the nebular lines, sample selection biases against red star-forming galaxies, and not accounting for Balmer absorption, can yield steeper slopes of the log(SFR){\textendash}log( M * ) relation. Our sample is immune from these biases as it is rest-frame optically selected, H $\alpha$ and H $\beta$ are corrected for Balmer absorption, and the H $\alpha$ luminosity is dust corrected using the nebular color excess computed from the Balmer decrement. The scatter of the log(SFR(H $\alpha$ )){\textendash}log( M * ) relation, after accounting for the measurement uncertainties, is 0.31 dex at 2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6, which is 0.05 dex larger than the scatter in log(SFR(UV)){\textendash}log( M * ). Based on comparisons to a simulated SFR{\textendash} M * relation with some intrinsic scatter, we argue that in the absence of direct measurements of galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the attenuation/extinction curves and the initial mass function, one cannot use the difference in the scatter of the SFR(H $\alpha$ ){\textendash} and SFR(UV){\textendash} M * relations to constrain the stochasticity of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.},

The star formation picture provided by a total of 10 497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stacking analysis of a mass complete sample of 62 361 star-forming galaxies from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Hubble {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Space Telescope (HST) {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band-selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep ground-based {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} band-selected catalogs in the GOODS{\textendash}North and the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and describe our method called {\textquotedblleft}scatter stacking{\textquotedblright}, which may be easily generalized to other experiments. The combination of direct UV and far-infrared UV-reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 4 to 0 of all stellar masses ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}*{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope of the log {\textless}sub{\textgreater}10{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}SFR{\textless}i/{\textgreater}){\textendash}log {\textless}sub{\textgreater}10{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}*{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) relation, with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log {\textless}sub{\textgreater}10{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}*{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}?{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) {\textgreater} 10.5) that becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ? 2. This flattening may be due to the parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies, which mostly happens over the same redshift range. Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about 68\% of star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a factor 2. The specific SFR (s{\textless}i{\textgreater}SFR{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = {\textless}i{\textgreater}SFR{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}*{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR history and on the origin of present-day stars: more than two-thirds of present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the {\textquotedblleft}main sequence{\textquotedblright} mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion years.},

These steeper low-mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu$m imaging; $\beta$-corrected UV SFRs; and H$\alpha$ SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than log (M */M ?) {\textless} 10 the specific SFR ($\Psi$/M *) is observed to be roughly self-similar with $\Psi$/M *?(1 + z)1.9, whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with $\Psi$/M *?(1 + z)2.2-3.5 for log (M */M ?) = 10.2-11.2.

In this paper, we describe the full details of the observations, data reduction, and photometry for the survey.

The redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in the COSMOS (AEGIS) fields, combining the NIR medium-bandwidth data with existing UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible and NIR (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Subaru Telescope), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC) imaging.

construct a large, deep (Ks {\textless} 24) sample of 220 000
galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our
analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing
these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the
zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of
$\sigma$$\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.008 at i+ {\textless} 22.5
and $\sigma$$\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.03 at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We
derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We
find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming
populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more
rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a
direct consequence of the star formation being "quenched" in galaxies
more massive than ? ? 1010.7 -
10.9??. For the mass function of the
quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the
high-mass end at z {\textless} 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the
faint-end slope. From z {\textasciitilde} 3 to z {\textasciitilde} 1, the density of quiescent galaxies
increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass
density increases by 1.6 dex between z {\textasciitilde} 3 and z {\textasciitilde} 1 and by less than
0.2 dex at z {\textless} 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass
density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent
agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z {\textless}
1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z {\textgreater} 1.5 consistent with
the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the
specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming
galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010 -
10.5?? galaxies increases continuously in
the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Finally, we compare our results with
a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the
density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while
the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully
reproduced.

(GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4-8
per cent of the baryon density (assuming $\Omega$b = 0.045).
There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction
and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable
universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z {\textless} 0.05
GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of
49968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various
estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass
upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has
$\alpha$2 {\textasciitilde}= -1.6. At masses below
{\textasciitilde}108.5Msolar, the GSMF may be significantly
incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One
interpretation of the stellar mass-metallicity relation is that it is
primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to
stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple
relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an
`implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a faint-end slope,
$\alpha$2 {\textasciitilde}= -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of
the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep
as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo
baryonic mass function -{\textgreater} galaxy baryonic mass function -{\textgreater} GSMF.
This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency
at baryonic masses {\textasciitilde}1011Msolar corresponding to a
minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have
levelled off at lower masses.},

	abstract = {We present the Dark-ages Reionization and Galaxy formation Observables 
from Numerical Simulations (DRAGONS) programme and Tiamat, the
collisionless N-body simulation programme upon which DRAGONS is built.
The primary trait distinguishing Tiamat from other large simulation
programme is its density of outputs at high redshift (100 from z = 35 to
z = 5; roughly one every 10 Myr) enabling the construction of very
accurate merger trees at an epoch when galaxy formation is rapid and
mergers extremely frequent. We find that the friends-of-friends halo
mass function agrees well with the prediction of Watson et al. at high
masses, but deviates at low masses, perhaps due to our use of a
different halo finder or perhaps indicating a break from `universal'
behaviour. We then analyse the dynamical evolution of galaxies during
the Epoch of Reionization finding that only a small fraction (\~{}20
per cent) of galactic haloes are relaxed. We illustrate this using
standard relaxation metrics to establish two dynamical recovery
time-scales: (I) haloes need \~{}1.5 dynamical times following
formation, and (II) \~{}2 dynamical times following a major (3:1) or
minor (10:1) merger to be relaxed. This is remarkably consistent across
a wide mass range. Lastly, we use a phase-space halo finder to
illustrate that major mergers drive long-lived massive phase-space
structures which take many dynamical times to dissipate. This can yield
significant differences in the inferred mass build-up of galactic haloes
and we suggest that care must be taken to ensure a physically meaningful
match between the galaxy formation physics of semi-analytic models and
the halo finders supplying their input.},

We find the total stellar content and black hole masses of the clusters to be in good agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters are too gas rich, suggesting that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model is not efficient enough at expelling gas from the high-redshift progenitors of the clusters. The X-ray properties, such as the spectroscopic temperature and the soft-band luminosity, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich properties are in reasonable agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters have too high central temperatures and larger-than-observed entropy cores, which is likely driven by the AGN feedback after the cluster core has formed. The total metal content and its distribution throughout the intracluster medium are a good match to the observations.},

This scale is valid over a range of redshifts and selection criteria. We present a procedure for estimating, given a measured galaxy overdensity, the protocluster probability and its descendant cluster mass for a range of modelling assumptions,
particularly taking into account the shape of the measurement aperture. This procedure produces lower protocluster probabilities compared to previous estimates using fixed size apertures. The relationship between active galactic nucleus (AGN) and protoclusters is also investigated and shows significant evolution with redshift; at z \~{} 2, the fraction of protoclusters traced by AGN is high, but the fraction of all AGNs in protoclusters is low, whereas at z >= 5 the fraction of protoclusters containing AGN is low, but most AGNs are in protoclusters. We also find indirect evidence for the emergence of a passive sequence in

At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass corresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher concentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion and star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with higher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, V{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max, DMO{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and binding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass, meaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide fitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration alone cannot explain the total scatter in the M\_star - M\_\{200, DMO\} relation, and it does not explain the scatter in M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-V{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max, DMO{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are also not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more complex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.},

We show that the scatter is smaller when gas-phase $\alpha$-enhancement is used rather than metallicity. A similar plane also exists for stellar $\alpha$-enhancement, implying that present-day specific SFRs are correlated with long time-scale star formation histories. Between z = 0 and 1, the $\alpha$-enhancement plane is even more insensitive to redshift than the plane using metallicity. However, it evolves at z \&gt; 1 due to lagging iron yields. At fixed mass, galaxies with higher SFRs have star formation histories shifted towards late times, are more $\alpha$-enhanced, and this $\alpha$-enhancement increases with redshift as observed. These findings suggest that relations between physical properties inferred from observations may be affected by systematic variations in $\alpha$-enhancements.},

Shorter time-scale fluctuations are relatively more important for lower mass galaxies. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency cause additional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo formation times. While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple times during their evolution, they fluctuate around tracks associated with their halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the main sequence at z = 0.1 tend to have been above/below the main sequence for >>1 Gyr.},

(PKS 1138 - 262), the Spiderweb galaxy, at z = 2.2. Our 0.5 mag deeper
narrow-band imaging than previous surveys collects a total of 68 H
$\alpha$ emitters (HAE). Here, 17 out of the 68 are newly discovered
protocluster members. First, a very high characteristic stellar mass of
M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast = 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.73\} M? is measured from a
Schechter function fit to the mass distribution of HAEs. Together with
the Chandra X-ray data, we find that four out of six massive HAEs
(M* {\textgreater} 1011 M?) show bright
X-ray emission, suggesting that they host active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
Their mass estimates, therefore, would be affected by the nuclear
emission from AGNs. Notably, the X-ray-detected HAEs are likely
positioned near the boundary between star-forming and quiescent
populations in the rest-frame UVJ plane. Moreover, our deep narrow-band
data succeed in probing the bright H $\alpha$ (+ [N II]) line nebula of
the Spiderweb galaxy extending over \~{}100 physical kpc. These
results suggest that the massive galaxies in the Spiderweb protocluster

galaxy clusters, where AGNs might play an essential role in their
quenching processes, though a more statistical database is needed to

We quantify the effect of lensing on the luminosity function of the high-redshift sources, focusing on the intermediate and small magnifications, $\mu$ ? 2, which affect the majority of the background galaxies, and comparing to the case of strong lensing. We show that, depending on the intrinsic properties of the background galaxies, gravitational lensing can significantly affect the observed luminosity function even when no obvious strong lenses are present. Finally, we find that in the case of the LBGs it is important to account for the surface brightness profiles of both the foreground and the background galaxies when computing the lensing statistics, which introduces a selection criterion for the background galaxies that can actually be observed. Not taking this criterion into account leads to an overestimation of the number densities of very bright galaxies by nearly two orders of magnitude.},

Given its resolution and volume, BlueTides can probe the bias and cosmic variance of \$z{\textgreater}7\$ galaxies between magnitude \$H{\textbackslash}sim30\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim25\$ over survey areas \${\textbackslash}sim0.1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{arcmin\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$. Within this regime, the cosmic variance decreases with survey area/ volume as a power law with exponents between \${\textbackslash}sim-0.25\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim-0.45\$. For the planned \$10{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ field of WFIRST, the cosmic variance is between \$6{\textbackslash}\%\$ to \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$. Upcoming JWST surveys with areas up to
\$A{\textbackslash}sim100{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{arcmin\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ will have cosmic variance ranging from \${\textbackslash}sim 20-40{\textbackslash}\%\$. Lensed surveys have the highest cosmic variance \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 60{\textbackslash}\%\$; these surveys require volumes \${\textbackslash}gtrsim(6{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}/h){\textasciicircum}3\$ and \${\textbackslash}gtrsim(11{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}/h){\textasciicircum}3\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}sim7.5\$ and \$z{\textbackslash}sim9\$ respectively to limit the cosmic variance to less than \$100{\textbackslash}\%\$. Finally, we find that cosmic variance is larger than Poisson variance and forms the dominant component of the overall uncertainty in all current and upcoming surveys. We present our calculations in the form of simple fitting functions and an online cosmic variance calculator (CV\_AT\_COSMIC\_DAWN) which we publicly release.},

EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce the stellar mass function and galaxy sizes at z = 0.1, and we assess whether this calibration also yields realistic H I properties. We estimate the self-shielding density with a fitting function calibrated using radiation transport simulations, and correct for molecular hydrogen with empirical or theoretical relations. The `standard-resolution' simulations systematically underestimate H I column densities, leading to an H I deficiency in low-mass (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) galaxies and poor reproduction of the observed H I mass function. These shortcomings are largely absent from EAGLE simulations featuring a factor of 8 (2) better mass (spatial) resolution, within which the H I mass of galaxies evolves more mildly from z = 1 to 0 than in the standard-resolution simulations. The largest volume simulation reproduces the observed clustering of H I systems, and its dependence on H I richness. At fixed M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, galaxies acquire more H I in simulations with stronger feedback, as they become associated with more massive haloes and higher infall rates. They acquire less H I in simulations with a greater star formation efficiency, since the star formation and feedback necessary to balance the infall rate is produced by smaller gas reservoirs. The simulations indicate that the H I of present-day galaxies was acquired primarily by the smooth accretion of ionized, intergalactic gas at z ? 1, which later self-shields, and that only a small fraction is contributed by the reincorporation of gas previously heated strongly by feedback. H I reservoirs are highly dynamic: over 40 per cent of H I associated with z = 0.1 galaxies is converted to stars or ejected by z = 0.},

The modelling includes a subgrid prescription for dusty star-forming regions, with both the subgrid obscuration of these regions and the fraction of metals in diffuse interstellar dust calibrated against far-infrared fluxes of local galaxies. The predicted optical colours as a function of stellar mass agree well with observation, with the skirt model showing marked improvement over a simple dust-screen model. The orientation dependence of attenuation is weaker than observed because eagle galaxies are generally puffier than real galaxies, due to the pressure floor imposed on the interstellar medium (ISM). The mock H $\alpha$ luminosity function agrees reasonably well with the data, and we quantify the extent to which dust obscuration affects observed H $\alpha$ fluxes. The distribution of D4000 break values is bimodal, as observed. In the simulation, 20 per cent of galaxies deemed 'passive' for the skirt model, I.e. exhibiting D4000 \&gt;1.8, are classified 'active' when ISM dust attenuation is not included. The fraction of galaxies with stellar mass greater than 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} that are deemed passive is slightly smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual star formation in these simulated galaxies.

In our analysis we consider 96 SMGs in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, 77 of which have 4-19 band photometry. We model the SEDs for these 77 SMGs, deriving a median photometric redshift of z phot = 2.3 {\textpm} 0.1. The remaining 19 SMGs have insufficient photometry to derive photometric redshifts, but a stacking analysis of Herschel observations confirms they are not spurious. Assuming that these SMGs have an absolute H-band magnitude distribution comparable to that of a complete sample of z \~{} 1-2 SMGs, we demonstrate that they lie at slightly higher redshifts, raising the median redshift for SMGs to z phot = 2.5 {\textpm} 0.2. Critically we show that the proportion of galaxies undergoing an SMG-like phase at z ? 3 is at most 35\% {\textpm} 5\% of the total population. We derive a median stellar mass of M * = (8 {\textpm} 1) {\texttimes} 1010 M ?, although there are systematic uncertainties of up to 5 {\texttimes} for individual sources. Assuming that the star formation activity in SMGs has a timescale of \~{}100 Myr, we show that their descendants at z \~{} 0 would have a space density and MH distribution that are in good agreement with those of local ellipticals. In addition, the inferred mass-weighted ages of the local ellipticals broadly agree with the look-back times of the SMG events. Taken together, these results are consistent with a simple model that identifies SMGs as events that form most of the stars seen in the majority of luminous elliptical galaxies at the present day.},

Spitzer/IRAC data to date and the relatively large volume allow us to
place a better constraint at both the low- and high-mass ends of the

our method of measuring the slope of the \{log\}\{M\}* -M

technique combining photometry of individual bright galaxies with
stacked photometry for faint galaxies. The resultant measured slopes do
not significantly evolve over z = 4-8, while the normalization of
the trend exhibits a weak evolution toward lower masses at higher

modelling of the radial structure of discs allows qualitatively new
comparisons with observation, most notably with the relative sizes and
masses of the stellar, atomic, and molecular components in discs. Good
agreement is found with recent data. Comparison of results obtained for
simulations differing in mass resolution by more than two orders of

	abstract = {Cosmic reionization by starlight from early galaxies affected their evolution, thereby impacting reionization, itself. Star formation suppression, for example, may explain the observed underabundance of Local Group dwarfs relative to N-body predictions for Cold Dark Matter. Reionization modelling requires simulating volumes large enough [{\textasciitilde}(100Mpc){\textasciicircum}3] to sample reionization "patchiness", while resolving millions of galaxy sources above {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun , combining gravitational and gas dynamics with radiative transfer. Modelling the Local Group requires initial cosmological density fluctuations pre-selected to form the well-known structures of the local universe today. Cosmic Dawn ("CoDa") is the first such fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of reionization of the local universe. Our new hybrid CPU-GPU code, RAMSES-CUDATON, performs hundreds of radiative transfer and ionization rate-solver timesteps on the GPUs for each hydro-gravity timestep on the CPUs. CoDa simulated (91Mpc){\textasciicircum}3 with 4096{\textasciicircum}3 particles and cells, to redshift 4.23, on ORNL supercomputer Titan, utilizing 8192 cores and 8192 GPUs. Global reionization ended slightly later than observed. However, a simple temporal rescaling which brings the evolution of ionized fraction into agreement with observations also reconciles ionizing flux density, cosmic star formation history, CMB electron scattering optical depth and galaxy UV luminosity function with their observed values. Photoionization heating suppressed the star formation of haloes below {\textasciitilde}2 x 10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun , decreasing the abun- dance of faint galaxies around MAB\_1600 = [-10,-12]. For most of reionization, star formation was dominated by haloes between 10{\textasciicircum}10 - 10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun , so low-mass halo suppression was not reflected by a distinct feature in the global star formation history.

	abstract = {We present the SPHINX suite of cosmological adaptive mesh refinement simulations, the first radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to simultaneously capture large-scale reionization and the escape of ionizing radiation from thousands of resolved galaxies. Our \$5\$ and \$10\$ co-moving Mpc volumes resolve haloes down to the atomic cooling limit and model the inter-stellar medium with better than \${\textbackslash}approx10\$ pc resolution. The project has numerous goals in improving our understanding of reionization and making predictions for future observations. In this first paper we study how the inclusion of binary stars in computing stellar luminosities impacts reionization, compared to a model that includes only single stars. Owing to the suppression of galaxy growth via strong feedback, our galaxies are in good agreement with observational estimates of the galaxy luminosity function. We find that binaries have a significant impact on the timing of reionization: with binaries, our boxes are \$99.9\$ percent ionized by volume at \$z{\textbackslash}approx 7\$, while without them our volumes fail to reionize by \$z=6\$. These results are robust to changes in volume size, resolution, and feedback efficiency. The escape of ionizing radiation from individual galaxies varies strongly and frequently. On average, binaries lead to escape fractions of \${\textbackslash}approx 7-10\$ percent, about \$3.5\$ times higher than with single stars only. The higher escape fraction is a result of a shallower decline in ionizing luminosity with age, and is the primary reason for earlier reionization, although the higher integrated luminosity with binaries also plays a sub-dominant role.},

	abstract = {A large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, Horizon-AGN, is used to investigate the alignment between the spin of galaxies and the cosmic filaments above redshift 1.2. The analysis of more than 150 000 galaxies per time step in the redshift range 1.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.8 with
morphological diversity shows that the spin of low-mass blue galaxies is preferentially aligned with their neighbouring filaments, while
high-mass red galaxies tend to have a perpendicular spin. The
reorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers, which are significant in their mass build-up. We find that the stellar mass transition from alignment to misalignment happens around 3 {\texttimes} 1010 M?. Galaxies form in the
vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migrate towards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angular momentum into spin. The signature of this process can be traced to the properties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. We argue that a strong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quench in situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various
morphologies. It allows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and, therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.},

	abstract = {This report describes the 2014 study by the Science Definition Team (SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

BlueTides is a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, which incorporates a variety of baryon physics in a \$(400h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$ volume evolved to \$z=8\$ with 0.7 trillion particles. The galaxy luminosity functions in the simulation show good agreement with all the current observational constraints (up to \$z=11\$) and predicts an enhanced number of UV bright galaxies. At the proposed depth of the HLS (\$m {\textless} 26.75\$), BlueTides predicts \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ galaxies at \$z=8\$ with a few up to \$z{\textbackslash}sim 15\$ due to the enhanced bright end of the galaxy luminosity function. At \$z=8\$, galaxies in the mock HLS have specific star formation rates of \${\textbackslash}sim 10 \{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and ages of \${\textbackslash}sim 80 \{{\textbackslash}rm Myr\}\$ (both evolving linearly with redshift) and a non-evolving mass-metallicity relation. BlueTides also predicts \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ AGN in WFIRST HLS from \$z=8\$ out to \$z{\textbackslash}sim 14\$. These AGN host black holes of \$M{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6-10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ accreting close to their Eddington luminosity. Galaxies and AGN have host halo masses of \$M\_\{halo\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11-12\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and a linear bias \$b{\textbackslash}approx 13-20\$. Given the expected galaxy space densities, their high bias and large volume probed we speculate that it may be feasible for WFIRST HLS detect the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation peak in the galaxy power spectrum out to \$z=8-9\$.},

	abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of {\textasciitilde}0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {\textless} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a
spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution {\textasciitilde}250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019.

This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z ? 1.5-8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z {\textgreater} 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS/Deep survey covers \~{}125 arcmin2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a total of \~{}800 arcmin2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey are presented in a companion paper.},

The objects have been selected on the basis of accurate photometric redshifts computed from multi-band photometry including seven HST bands and deep K s and IRAC observations. Magnification is computed on an object-by-object basis from all available lensing models of the two clusters. We take into account source detection completeness as a function of luminosity and size, magnification effects, and systematics in the lens modeling of the clusters under investigation. We find that our sample of high-z galaxies constrain the cutoff halo circular velocity below which star formation is suppressed by photoionization feedback to km s-1. This circular velocity corresponds to a halo mass of ?5.6 {\texttimes} 109 M ? and ?2.3 {\texttimes} 109 M ? at z = 5 and 10, respectively: higher-mass halos can thus sustain continuous star formation activity without being quenched by external ionizing flux. More stringent constraints are prevented by the uncertainty in the modeling of the cluster lens, as embodied by systematic differences among the lens models available.},

The standard theoretical model based on an array of recent observations accurately predicts the physical conditions in the early Universe, and powerful super-computers allow us to simulate in detail the formation and evolution of cosmic structure to the present epoch. We review recent progress in the study on the first generation of stars and blackholes. We focus on the physics of early structure formation, while identifying several key issues and open questions.

at z\~{} 8. We also investigate the systematic uncertainty due to the lens modeling by using every available lens model individually and comparing the results; this systematic fractional uncertainty on $\alpha$ is {\textless} 4 \% at all redshifts. We now directly observe galaxies in the luminosity regime where some simulations predict a change in the faint-end slope of the luminosity function, yet our results provide statistically very strong evidence against any turnover in the
luminosity range probed, more consistent with simulations in which stars form in lower-mass halos. Thus, we find strong support for the extension of the steep luminosity function to \{M\}\{UV\}=-13 at z{\textgreater} 6, consistent with the number of faint galaxies needed to reionize the universe under standard assumptions.},

MBII is the highest resolution simulation of this size which includes a self-consistent model for star formation, black hole accretion and associated feedback. We provide a simulation browser web application which enables interactive search and tagging of halos, subhalos and their properties and publicly release our galaxy catalogs. Our analysis of the halo mass function (MF) in MBII reveals that baryons have strong effects, with changes in the halo abundance of 20-35\% below the knee of the MF (Mhalo {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}13.2 Msun/h at z=0) when compared to fits based on dark matter only simulations. We provide a fitting function for the halo MF out to redshift z=11 and discuss how the onset of non-universality in the MF limits the accuracy of our fit. We study the halo occupation distribution and clustering of galaxies, in particular the evolution and scale dependence of stochasticity and bias finding reasonable agreement with observational data. The shape of the cosmic spectral energy distribution predicted by MBII is consistent with observations, but lower in amplitude. The Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) function is broadly consistent with observations at z{\textgreater}=2. At z{\textless}2, the population of passive low mass (for M*{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun) galaxies in MBII makes the GSMF too steep compared to observations whereas at the high mass end (M*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun) galaxies hosting bright AGNs make significant contributions to the GSMF. The quasar bolometric luminosity function is also largely consistent with observations. We note however that more efficient AGN feedback (beyond simple thermal coupling used here) is likely necessary for the largest, rarest objects/clusters at low redshifts.},

Most critically, we show that the ultraviolet luminosity function of our simulated galaxies is consistent with observations of high-z galaxy populations at the bright end of the luminosity function , but at lower luminosities is essentially flat rather than rising steeply, as has been inferred by Schechter function fits to high-z observations, and has a clearly defined lower limit in UV luminosity. This behavior of the luminosity function is due to two factors: (i) the strong dependence of the star formation rate (SFR) on halo virial mass in our simulated galaxy population, with lower-mass halos having systematically lower SFRs and thus lower UV luminosities; and (ii) the fact that halos with virial masses below do not universally contain stars, with the fraction of halos containing stars dropping to zero at . Finally, we show that the brightest of our simulated galaxies may be visible to current and future ultra-deep space-based surveys, particularly if lensed regions are chosen for observation.},

\{\~{} \}10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} M\_? yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} by z ? 10, remaining largely
unaffected by the presence of Pop II feedback. At z = 7.5, \{\~{} \} 20\{\{ per cent\}\} of Pop III star formation occurs in isolated haloes that have never experienced any Pop II star formation (i.e. primordial haloes). We predict that Pop III-only galaxies exist at magnitudes MUV ? -11, beyond the limits for direct detection with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess that our stellar mass function (SMF) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) agree well with the observed low
mass/faint-end behaviour at z = 8 and 10. However, beyond the current limiting magnitudes, we find that both our SMF and UVLF demonstrate a deviation/turnover from the expected power-law slope
(MUV,turn = -13.4 {\textpm} 1.1 at z = 10). This could impact observational estimates of the true SFRD by a factor of 2(10) when integrating to MUV = -12 (-8) at z \~{} 10, depending on integration limits. Our turnover correlates well with the transition from dark matter haloes dominated by molecular cooling to those
dominated by atomic cooling, for a mass Mhalo ? 108 M? at z ? 10.},

Under our standard galaxy formation scenario such fast growth implies large gas densities providing sustained accretion at critical or supercritical rates onto an initial black hole seed. It has been a long standing question whether and how such high black hole accretion rates can be achieved and sustained at the centers of early galaxies. Here we use our new MassiveBlack cosmological hydrodynamic simulation covering a volume (0.75 Gpc)3 appropriate for studying the rare first quasars to show that steady high density cold gas flows responsible for assembling the first galaxies produce the high gas densities that lead to sustained critical accretion rates and hence rapid growth commensurate with the existence of \~{}109 M ? black holes as early as z \~{} 7. We find that under these conditions quasar feedback is not effective at stopping the cold gas from penetrating the central regions and hence cannot quench the accretion until the host galaxy reaches . This cold-flow-driven scenario for the formation of quasars implies that they should be ubiquitous in galaxies in the early universe and that major (proto)galaxy mergers are not a requirement for efficient fuel supply and growth, particularly for the earliest SMBHs.},

SFR-M* relation of z = 1-4 galaxies using the SKIRT
simulated spectral energy distributions of galaxies sampled from the
Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments simulations.
We derive SFRs and stellar masses by mimicking different observational
techniques. We find that the tension between observed and simulated
SFR-M* relations is largely alleviated if similar
methods are used to infer the galaxy properties. We find that relations
relying on infrared wavelengths (e.g. 24 \{ $\mu$ m\}, MIPS - 24, 70, and
160 \{ $\mu$ m\} or SPIRE - 250, 350, and 500 \{ $\mu$ m\}) have SFRs that
exceed the intrinsic relation by 0.5 dex. Relations that rely on the
spectral energy distribution fitting technique underpredict the SFRs at
a fixed stellar mass by -0.5 dex at z \~{} 4 but overpredict the
measurements by 0.3 dex at z \~{} 1. Relations relying on
dust-corrected rest-frame ultraviolet luminosities, are flatter since
they overpredict/underpredict SFRs for low/high star-forming objects and
yield deviations from the intrinsic relation from 0.10 to -0.13 dex at z
\~{} 4. We suggest that the severe tension between different
observational studies can be broadly explained by the fact that
different groups employ different techniques to infer their SFRs.},

primordial and mature galaxy formation in which galaxies considerably
increase their stellar mass, metallicity, and dust content. The study of

early galaxy formation and the fate of galaxies at later times. Here, we
investigate the burstiness of the recent star formation history (SFH) of
221z \~{} 4.5 main-sequence galaxies at \{log\}(M/\{M\}?
){\textgreater} 9.7 by comparing their ultra-violet (UV) continuum, H$\alpha$
luminosity, and H$\alpha$ equivalent-width (EW). The H$\alpha$ properties
are derived from the Spitzer [3.6 $\mu$m]-[4.5 $\mu$m] broadband
color, thereby properly taking into account model and photometric
uncertainties. We find a significant scatter between H$\alpha$- and
UV-derived luminosities and star formation rates (SFRs). About half of
the galaxies show a significant excess in H$\alpha$ compared to
expectations from a constant smooth SFH. We also find a tentative
anticorrelation between H$\alpha$ EW and stellar mass, ranging from 1000
{\r A} at \{log\}(M/\{M\}? ){\textless} 10 to below 100 {\r A} at
\{log\}(M/\{M\}? ){\textgreater} 11. Consulting models suggests that
most z \~{} 4.5 galaxies had a burst of star formation within the last
50 Myr, increasing their SFRs by a factor of {\textgreater}5. The most massive
galaxies on the other hand might decrease their SFRs and may be
transitioning to a quiescent stage by z = 4. We identify differential
dust attenuation (f) between stars and nebular regions as the main
contributor to the uncertainty. With local galaxies selected by
increasing H$\alpha$ EW (reaching values similar to high-z galaxies), we
predict that f approaches unity at z {\textgreater} 4, consistent with the
extrapolation of measurements out to z = 2.},

SKA1 21-cm power spectra, which are consistent with current
observations, but assume different properties for the unseen, ultrafaint

we predict up to a factor of 2-3 improvement (compared with Hubble Space

regulating the ultraviolet (UV) galaxy properties can be constrained at
the level of \~{}10 per cent or better, if either (i) we are able to
better characterize systematic lensing uncertainties than currently
possible; or (ii) the intrinsic LFs peak at magnitudes brighter than
MUV ? -13. Otherwise, improvement over HST-based
inference is modest. When combining with upcoming 21-cm observations, we
are able to significantly mitigate degeneracies, and constrain all of

Radiative feedback operates before the first supernova explosions erupt and results in less tightly bound galaxies.

Consequently, the number of satellites with M\_\{{\textbackslash}star \} {\textgreater} 107 M\_\{? \}

on galaxies identified in rest-frame ultraviolet light1.
However, this population of galaxies is known to under-represent the
most massive galaxies, which have rich dust content and/or old stellar
populations. This raises the questions of the true abundance of massive
galaxies and the star-formation-rate density in the early Universe.
Although several massive galaxies that are invisible in the ultraviolet
have recently been confirmed at early epochs2-4, most of them
are extreme starburst galaxies with star-formation rates exceeding 1,000
solar masses per year, suggesting that they are unlikely to represent
the bulk population of massive galaxies. Here we report submillimetre
(wavelength 870 micrometres) detections of 39 massive star-forming
galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3, which are unseen in the spectral region from the
deepest ultraviolet to the near-infrared. With a space density of about
2 {\texttimes} 10-5 per cubic megaparsec (two orders of magnitude
higher than extreme starbursts5) and star-formation rates of
200 solar masses per year, these galaxies represent the bulk population
of massive galaxies that has been missed from previous surveys. They
contribute a total star-formation-rate density ten times larger than
that of equivalently massive ultraviolet-bright galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3.
Residing in the most massive dark matter haloes at their redshifts, they
are probably the progenitors of the largest present-day galaxies in
massive groups and clusters. Such a high abundance of massive and dusty
galaxies in the early Universe challenges our understanding of
massive-galaxy formation.},

existing ALMA observations of galaxies with similarly high redshifts and
stellar masses. In both simulated and observed galaxies, the dust
continuum emission is generally more compact than the cold gas and the
dust mass, but more extended than the stellar component. The most
extreme cases of compact dust emission seem to be driven by particularly
compact recent star formation, which generates steep dust temperature
gradients. Our results confirm that the spatial extent of the dust
continuum emission is sensitive to both the dust mass and star formation

These objects start emitting ultraviolet radiation that carves out ionized regions around them.

This period, during which the cosmic gas went from neutral to ionized, is known as the Universe{\textquoteright}s Epoch of Reionization. The Epoch of Reionization is related to many fundamental questions in cosmology, such as properties of the first galaxies, physics of (mini-)quasars, formation of very metal-poor stars and a slew of other important research topics in astrophysics. Hence uncovering it will have far reaching implications on the study of structure formation in the early Universe. This chapter reviews the current observational evidence for the occurrence of this epoch, its key theoretical aspects and main characteristics, and finally the various observational probes that promise to uncover it. A special emphasis is put on the redshifted 21 cm probe, the various experiments that are currently being either built or designed, and what we can learn from them about the Epoch of Reionization.},

stellar mass (M *) through the $\sigma$
sSFR-M * relation in z \~{} 0-4.
We find that the relation evolves with time, with the dispersion depending on both stellar mass and redshift. The models point to an evolving U-shaped form for the $\sigma$ sSFR-M
* relation, with the scatter being minimal at a
characteristic mass M * of 109.5 M
? and increasing both at lower and higher masses. This implies that the diversity of SFHs increases toward both the low- and high-mass ends. We find that feedback from active galactic nuclei is important for increasing the $\sigma$ sSFR for high-mass
objects. On the other hand, we suggest that feedback from supernovae increases the $\sigma$ sSFR of galaxies at the low-mass end. We also find that excluding galaxies that have experienced recent mergers does not significantly affect the $\sigma$
sSFR-M * relation. Furthermore, we
employ the EAGLE simulations in combination with the radiative transfer code SKIRT to evaluate the effect of SFR/stellar mass diagnostics in the $\sigma$ sSFR-M * relation, and find

destruction due to supernova-induced shocks, star formation, and
reheating. Our grain growth model follows the dust content in molecular
clouds and the inter-cloud medium separately, and allows growth only on
pre-existing dust grains. At early times, this can make a significant
difference to the dust growth rate. Above z \~{} 8, type II SNe are the

DTM ratio of galaxies at any redshift. At z ? 3, we find a fairly

our simulations. We find that the IRX-$\beta$UV relation is
mainly determined by the shape of the attenuation law and is independent
of its normalization (set by the dust-to-gas ratio). The bolometric IR
luminosity (LIR) correlates with the intrinsic UV luminosity
and the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over the past 10 Myr. We
predict that at a given LIR, the peak wavelength of the dust
spectral energy distributions for z >= 5 galaxies is smaller by a
factor of 2 (due to higher dust temperatures on average) than at z = 0.
The higher dust temperatures are driven by higher specific SFRs and SFR
surface densities with increasing redshift. We derive the galaxy UV

confirm that a heavy attenuation is required to reproduce the observed

emerging from galaxies themselves, and, in the distributions of neutral
gas in the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). We also
study the relations between apparent Ly $\alpha$ luminosity and various

observations of the bulk of distant galaxies at the epoch of
reionization. The recovery of their properties, such as age, color
excess E(B-V), specific star formation rate (sSFR), and stellar mass,
will mostly rely on spectral energy distribution fitting, based on the
data provided by JWST's two imager cameras, namely the Near Infrared
Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infrared Imager (MIRI). In this work we
analyze the effect of choosing different combinations of NIRCam and MIRI
broadband filters, from 0.6 to 7.7 $\mu$m, on the recovery of these
galaxy properties. We performed our tests on a sample of 1542 simulated
galaxies, with known input properties, at z = 7-10. We found that,
with only eight NIRCam broadbands, we can recover the galaxy age within
0.1 Gyr and the color excess within 0.06 mag for 70\% of the galaxies.
Additionally, the stellar masses and sSFR are recovered within 0.2 and
0.3 dex, respectively, at z = 7-9. Instead, at z = 10, no NIRCam
band traces purely the $\lambda$ {\textgreater} 4000 {\r A} regime and the
percentage of outliers in stellar mass (sSFR) increases by {\textgreater}20\%
({\textgreater}90\%), in comparison to z = 9. The MIRI F560W and F770W bands are
crucial to improve the stellar mass and the sSFR estimation at z = 10.
When nebular emission lines are present, deriving correct galaxy
properties is challenging at any redshift and with any band combination.
In particular, the stellar mass is systematically overestimated in up to
0.3 dex on average with NIRCam data alone and including MIRI

To understand the properties of these observed galaxies, it is crucial to understand the star formation (SF) history of high-redshift galaxies under the
influence of stellar feedback. In this work, we present the results of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with zoom-in initial conditions, and investigate the formation of the first galaxies and their evolution toward observable galaxies at z\~{} 6. We focus on three different
galaxies that end up in halos with masses \{M\}\{\{h\}\}=2.4{\texttimes} \{10\}10 \{h\}-1 \{M\}? (Halo-10),
1.6{\texttimes} \{10\}11 \{h\}-1 \{M\}?

\{M\}? (Halo-12) at z = 6. Our simulations also probe the impacts of different subgrid assumptions, I.e., SF efficiency and cosmic reionization, on SF histories in the first galaxies. We find that SF occurs intermittently due to supernova (SN) feedback at z? 10, and then it proceeds more smoothly as the halo mass grows at lower
redshifts. Galactic disks are destroyed due to SN feedback, while galaxies in simulations with no feedback or lower SF efficiency models can sustain a galactic disk for long periods ? 10 \{Myr\}. The
expulsion of gas at the galactic center also affects the inner dark matter density profile for a short period. Our simulated galaxies in Halo-11 and Halo-12 reproduce the SF rates and stellar masses of observed Ly$\alpha$ emitters at z\~{} 7\{--\}8 fairly well given the

	abstract = {To understand the evolution of extinction curve, we calculate the dust evolution in a galaxy using smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations incorporating stellar dust production, dust destruction in supernova shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by shattering. The dust species are separated into carbonaceous dust and silicate. The evolution of grain size distribution is considered by dividing grain population into large and small grains, which allows us to estimate extinction curves. We examine the dependence of extinction curves on the position, gas density and metallicity in the galaxy, and find that extinction curves are flat at t ? 0.3 Gyr because stellar dust production dominates the total dust abundance. The 2175 {\r A}
bump and far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise become prominent after dust growth by accretion. At t ? 3 Gyr, shattering works efficiently in the
outer disc and low-density regions, so extinction curves show a very strong 2175 {\r A} bump and steep FUV rise. The extinction curves at t ? 3 Gyr are consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve, which implies that we successfully included the necessary dust processes in the model. The outer disc component caused by stellar feedback has an extinction curve with a weaker 2175 {\r A} bump and flatter FUV slope. The strong contribution of carbonaceous dust tends to underproduce the FUV rise in the Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve, which supports selective loss of small carbonaceous dust in the galaxy. The snapshot at young ages also explains the extinction curves in high-redshift quasars.},

black holes (BHs), and galaxies formed and assembled, sowing the seeds
of galaxies as we know them today. Detecting, identifying, and
understanding the first galaxies and BHs is one of the current
observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy formation. In this
paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at galaxies, BHs,
and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model builds a
population based on empirical relations. The spectral energy
distribution of galaxies is determined by age and metallicity, and that
of AGNs by BH mass and accretion rate. We validate the model against
observations, and predict properties of galaxies and AGN in other
wavelength and/or luminosity ranges, estimating the contamination of
stellar populations (normal stars and high-mass X-ray binaries) for AGN
searches from the infrared to X-rays, and vice versa for galaxy
searches. For high-redshift galaxies with stellar ages {\textless} 1 \{Gyr\}, we
find that disentangling stellar and AGN emission is challenging at
restframe UV/optical wavelengths, while high-mass X-ray binaries become
more important sources of confusion in X-rays. We propose a
color-color selection in the James Webb Space Telescope bands to
separate AGN versus star-dominated galaxies in photometric observations.
We also estimate the AGN contribution, with respect to massive, hot, and
metal-poor stars, at driving high-ionization lines, such as C IV and He
II. Finally, we test the influence of the minimum BH mass and occupation
fraction of BHs in low-mass galaxies on the restframe UV/near-IR and

constraints on both the galaxy stellar mass function and far-UV (150 nm) luminosity function. Galaxies in BlueTides are characterized by rapidly increasing star formation histories. Specific star formation rates decrease with redshift though remain largely insensitive to stellar mass. As a result of the enhanced surface density of metals, more massive galaxies are predicted to have higher dust attenuation resulting in a significant steepening of the observed far-UV luminosity function at high luminosities. The contribution of active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to the UV luminosities of galaxies with stellar masses 109-10 M? is around 3 per cent on average. Approximately 25 per cent of galaxies with M* ?
1010 M? are predicted to have active SMBHs that contribute {\textgreater}10 per cent of the total UV luminosity.},

demonstrate that the emission from faint unresolved satellite sources,

physical kpc from the centers of LAEs. We discuss how our profiles
depend on various model assumptions and how these can be tested and
constrained with future H$\alpha$ observations by the James Webb Space

constrain (I) the presence of otherwise undetectable satellite sources,
(II) the integrated, volumetric production rates of Ly$\alpha$ and LyC

modelling the interstellar medium (ISM) and interpreting Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Simulations with and without stellar radiation are compared at large (Mpc), intermediate (tens of kpc) and small (sub-kpc) scales. At large scales, the dense regions around galaxies reionize first before ultraviolet (UV) photons penetrate the voids; however, considerable amounts of neutral gas remain present within the haloes. The spatial distribution of neutral gas is highly dynamic and is anticorrelated with the presence of stars older than a few Myr. For our specific feedback implementation, most of the metals remain inside the virial radii of haloes, and they are proportionally distributed over the ionized and neutral media by mass. For our most massive galaxy with Mh \~{} 1011
M?, the majority of the C II and O I masses are
associated with cold neutral clumps. N II is more diffuse and arises in warmer gas, while O III arises in hotter gas with a higher ionization parameter, produced by photoheating and supernovae. If smaller pockets of high-metallicity gas exist in the ISM, the emission from these ions may be observable by ALMA, while the low metallicity of the galaxy may cause these systems to fall below the local [C II]-star formation rate relation. The presence of dust can cause spatial offsets between UV/Lyman $\alpha$ and [C II] emissions, as suggested by the recent
observations of Maiolino et al. [O III] may be spatially offset from both of these components since it arises from a different part of density-temperature phase space.},

There are mild but significant discrepancies, such as perhaps too many high-SFR galaxies, overly metal-rich and H I-poor galaxies at M* ? 2 {\texttimes} 1010 M?, and specific star
formation rates that are too low at z \~{} 1-2. The H I mass function increases by {\texttimes}2 out to z \~{} 1, then steepens to higher

High-redshift galaxy stellar mass functions can thus place interesting limits on number densities of massive haloes, which are otherwise very difficult to measure. Although halo mass functions at z {\textless} 8 are consistent with observed galaxy stellar masses if galaxy baryonic conversion efficiencies increase with redshift, JWST(James Webb Space Telescope) and WFIRST(Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope) will more than double the redshift range over which useful constraints are available. We calculate maximum galaxy stellar masses as a function of redshift given expected halo number densities from $\Lambda$CDM. We apply similar arguments to black holes. If their virial mass estimates are accurate, number density constraints alone suggest that the quasars SDSS J1044-0125 and SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 likely have black hole mass to stellar mass ratios higher than the median z = 0 relation, confirming the expectation from Lauer bias.

conditions in the early Universe allow the fastest BH growth.
Large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of structure
formation allow us to explore the conditions conducive to the growth of
the earliest supermassive BHs. We use the cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation BlueTides, which incorporates a variety of baryon physics in
a (400 h-1Mpc)3 volume with 0.7 trillion particles

the most massive (with M\_BH = 4 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_\{?\}) being found in
an extremely compact (compared to present day) spheroid-dominated host
galaxy. Examining the large-scale environment of hosts, we find that the
initial tidal field is more important than overdensity in setting the
conditions for early BH growth. In regions of low tidal fields gas
accretes 'cold' on to the BH and falls along thin, radial filaments
straight into the centre forming the most compact galaxies and most
massive BHs at the earliest times. Regions of high tidal fields instead
induce larger coherent angular momenta and influence the formation of
the first population of massive compact discs. The extreme early growth
depends on the early interplay of high gas densities and the tidal field
that shapes the mode of accretion. Mergers may play a minor role in the
formation of the first generation, rare massive BHs.},

agreement between observations and the predicted galaxy luminosity function in the currently observable range -18 <= MUV <= -22.5 with some dust extinction required to match the abundance of brighter objects. The predicted number counts for galaxies fainter than current observational limits are consistent with extrapolating the faint-end slope of the luminosity function with a power-law index $\alpha$ \~{} -1.8 at z \~{} 8 and redshift dependence of $\alpha$ \~{}
(1 + z)-0.4. The AGN population has a luminosity function well fit by a power law with a slope $\alpha$ \~{} -2.4 that compares
favourably with the deepest CANDELS GOODS fields. We investigate how these luminosity functions affect the progress of reionization, and find that a high Lyman $\alpha$ escape fraction (fesc \~{} 0.5) is
required if galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget during
reionization. Smaller galaxy escape fractions imply a large contribution from faint AGN (down to MUV = -12) which results in a rapid reionization, disfavoured by current observations.},

	abstract = {We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman \& Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \~{}N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our
implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},
